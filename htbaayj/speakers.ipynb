And it’s Madeleine L’Engle’s book A Wrinkle in Time and it’s a children’s book, and it’s part of her Time Trilogy which won all kinds of wonderful awards. And I love it because of the science in it.', 'They really took a role. They saw themselves as healers. And Wrzesniewski explained to me that when the hospital found out about this, the custodians were often told not to do this, because this was not part of their job description.', 'John, thanks so much for joining us here on the How to be Awesome at Your Job podcast.', 'Kim, that’s dead on, thank you. Please, unpack the others just like this.', 'And he kind of got a little upset about this, he said, “No, I got lots of friends.” And I said, “Yes, you do. Yes, you do. But you don’t have a lot of people that you need. And I don’t mean need for, ‘Give me a ride to the store,’ or, ‘Let me borrow a couple of sugars.’ You don’t have a lot of people that need in the way that when you need encouragement, wisdom, somebody to be there, somebody to challenge you.” And he said, “Well, maybe I don’t, but that feels selfish.” And about this time the wife came in, who was listening, and she goes, “Joe, you better listen to this guy because I really don’t like being the only person you can talk to.”', 'Christine E. Hassler', 'So, yeah, if you can get that phone out of your bedroom, or your laptop, or your pad, or whatever, read a real book. Chuck Zeiser did a wonderful study several years ago that said, “Look, if you actually read a physical book with an indirect light it’s much better for your sleep than reading and e-reader.” Now we talked about blue light as being the enemy, it’s a great thing in the morning. Knock yourself out with that phone in your face when you first wake up in the morning. That’s wonderful. We want light in our face in the morning. It’s just that at night you really need to kind of create a situation.', 'You know, this is the back in the olden days, and I don’t know if this is true now. We had to memorize a poem, and I think this might’ve been third or fourth grade. And I think I probably memorized this one because it was dark but it was powerful. And it’s “Invictus,” it’s the last stanza of “Invictus” by William Ernest Henley.', 'What I know is, Pete, if I hold your ladder, you’re going to climb higher than if I don’t hold your ladder. I’m going to allow you to what I would call achieve a couple of extra rungs in your life. You’re going to go a little bit higher than you’d go if I wasn’t there. That’s kind of a shift that I made from “I’m just going to climb my own ladder and build my own thing and do my own thing” to “Well, shoot, why don’t I go help some other people.” I made the shift to a ladder holder.', 'Arianna Huffington sells on her Thrive Global webpage this little bed. It’s like a Barbie doll bed but it’s for your family’s cellphones. And so it’s a symbol where you put this thing in your kitchen, and everybody puts their phones to bed at night.', 'That’s so good. I learned that in consulting with interviews of customers or for clients or employees or competitors. It really is amazing how often it’s toward the end that you get the goods. I have a variation of that Brad. I won’t spoil the fun, but one is coming your way.', 'Now that’s going to be hard for me because normally I’ve got 17 solutions and I’d like to go in and say, “Pete, could you give me like 50 people so we could try these things out?” But recognizing you’re a motivator, I can enhance that and bring it over to my side to engage you to use your desire for power to help me solve my problem.', 'I thought you might ask this question and it’s not necessarily a piece of study but it’s a framework that comes out of two academics at Harvard Bob Kegan and Lisa Lahey. It’s a framework called the Immunity to Change model, it’s a really powerful, step by step approach to helping our self or someone else understand what’s getting in the way of a change they’re trying to make and keep on failing at.', 'You can also for instance talk about meditative practices that are within the spheres of religion some people would have more comfort with for a lot of different reasons that is the desert fathers of the Christian stripe in that sense, like St. John of the Cross, the Cloud of Unknowing. Rumi was a Sufi mystic who meditated.', 'Thank you. And Kim, if folks want to learn more or get in touch, where would you point them?', 'We focus so much on careers and striving and everything, and so what I tell them, and I learned this from a guy, we race sailboats for years, named Jimmy Maloney. We raced together for years, and every weekend he would say, “Work is overrated. Work sucks. Work is overrated.” And one day he and his wife, they did the classic thing, they sold everything, they bought a sailboat, they’re excellent sailors, and they went cruising for two years with their three school-age kids.', 'Well said. Well, Christine, tell me, anything else you want to really make sure to mention before we shift gears and hear some of your favorite things?', 'Yeah. It’s true and you tend to connect everything with the Kardashians, so it’s just your mind works in certain ways and you really can’t help it.', 'Yeah, I looked up – I was thinking about something that would be interesting. Sorry, I have to scroll down because I have all these quotes saved in my files. This is a Picasso quote that I like which is, “I am always doing that which I cannot do in order that I may learn how to do it.”', 'That’s funny. Now, Aveeno, that’s a pretty big name I’d imagine when it comes to hand modeling. Was that your star showing?', 'Fast is faster and forward, Pete, is shorter. What I mean by that is when I started leading, my gosh, when they talked about – when I was working on a business degree when they talked about a long-range plan, they talked about ten years. A medium-range plan was five and the short-range, the short-range plan was two. Well, that’s a ridiculously long-range plan today, two years. You kind of say, “Boy, can you get it down to 12 to 18 months.”', 'Well, I think there are a lot of different ways you can do that. Mindfulness space stress reduction is popularized by John Kabat-Zinn, an Emeritus professor at University of Massachusetts, who has created a program there.', 'And we all need to have that conversation, in the privacy of your own house, of course. But you need to have that conversation with that 90-year-old or 100-year-old version of yourself, and then you will be scared not to do it. Then you will be afraid. “Oh my goodness. Am I going to end up having regrets?” And don’t be afraid to fail. I call it failing forward. James Dyson, I call the serial failure. He’s the guy who invented the bagless vacuum cleaner. Now you look at a guy that’s got a lovely British accent who has made billions of dollars with this revolutionary product. But what you don’t know is that it took him 15 years and he had 5126 prototypes that totally sucked, or maybe I should say, that didn’t suck.', 'Okay, perfect. Well Bill, thanks so much. This has been a real treat. I wish you tons of luck with your writing and the book sales, and the new interesting pathways you choose to explore.', 'Thanks so much, Pete, for having me.', 'Well, there are many, but Eleanor Roosevelt has always said one that I have embraced, which is, “The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.” And that I find inspiring, and my business partner, Mats Lederhausen, has a variant off of that, which I have used now, which is, “Believe more than you can so that you can more than you believe.”', 'Then, again, all this does is evolves into the next natural shift. As I’m extending your ladder, we’ve got that baby up pretty high. Pete, you take that extension, just keep on climbing. All the sudden I realized you could basically climb as high as we can extend. There’s really no limits to you.', 'Now that’s so intriguing, Kim. And I’m trying to be nice and I think I’m often likeable, and so I’m wondering, is it sort of no correlation or a negative correlation, like I’d be better off if I’m a little meaner?', 'Thank you so much. Thank you, Pete. You do the same.', 'Studied the Good Samaritan. Yeah. It’s amazing I think sometimes once we get headed in a direction, how hard it is to turn ourselves about, but that’s a great example of what it means to actually put into practice what logically you’ve put into a different part of your brain.', 'He said, “Well, Brad, do you know what could reduce our attrition, reduce our turnover?” and kind of went on a little bit about how he was interested in keeping people around, helping them learn more.', 'Oh, yeah. So I have a podcast item with Kim Scott. She’s just unbelievable. And that, to me, it sounds to me as one of those situations where that person who she confronted gently was not doing radical candor, and the message that’s being sent, “Tell me the truth. Don’t stab me in the back. Let’s talk about this directly.” I’ll just tell you, I’m a huge Kim Scott fan, and that is a great book – Radical Candor.', 'Yeah, first the reason it’s weighty and it’s out there is because, first, think about it. If you change 10 people, Pete, and they elected to change 10 other people, and those 10 people elected to positively change 10 others, yes, it sounds weighty, it sounds ambitious, it sounds audacious but that’s how real big transformative change happens, and that’s why we need to be much more in the business of being good people producing other good people, or leaders producing other leaders rather than just leaders creating followers.', 'Well, Christine, this has been a ton of fun. I wish you all the best of luck with your retreats and keynotes and coaching and podcast, Over it & On with it.', 'Boy, the moment that you begin to – when you begin to understand – I had a mentor named Charles Blair who said, “John, always have an understanding so there’s not a misunderstanding.” I just live that kind of a leadership life. I’m very comfortable with asking questions. What’s beautiful, it doesn’t take a long time.', 'Awesome. Well, Ed, this has been a whole lot of fun and insightful and enjoyable, so thank you for taking this time, and I wish you tons of luck in boxing, in physics, in chess and all the stuff you do.', 'That’s what pulled me back to the discussion, so go back to the Pat Summitt, University of Tennessee illustration. She was in total control when she walked in that room because she was getting out of the girls exactly what she needed. “What did we do right? What did we do wrong? What do we need to change?” She was in complete control, but while she was in control, she was also getting information that was very essential to her to lead them to the next step.', 'Brad, thank you for this. This has been so fun and interesting. I wish you and Never Stop Learning and your work all the success and luck in the world.', 'Well, here’s one. I have a colleague in the U.K., Edna Murdoch, who has a quote, she says, “Who you are is how you coach.” And that just speaks so much, gets to the heart of this work on self as coach. Who we are is how we coach, it’s how we lead, it’s how we show up. And so, we need to know who we are.', 'Geez, I like Buckminster Fuller’s quote, and I am not going to get it exact. But it’s something to the extent that to really change how something is working, you have to start over. You can’t just add on. And so I use it a lot at the end of my speeches. Of course, I didn’t memorize it. I think Buckminster Fuller, pretty much everything he kind of has come to and shared, that we’re now aware of his lexicon of ideas, is helpful.', 'I remember that exact question coming to me at one point in time when I was asked by the president, the company I was working for, “Michael, how can we become more innovative?”', 'Kim, thanks so much for joining us here on the How To Be Awesome At Your Job podcast.', 'And I dug, you know, this kind of harkens back to we had Tom Bilyeu back in episode 209 talking about your identity is hugely powerful, like who you say you are as the kind of person you are, and thusly things just flow from that. So, did you have like a particular statement in terms of, “Who I am is this”? Or is it more just sort of, “Who I am is the kind of person that does this and does not do that”?', 'Yeah. You talk to anyone that’s had success and there’s a certain element of luck in there, but as Mark Twain said, “The harder I work, the luckier I get.”', 'Well, I started working there about eleven years ago. It was my first role as a coach and before that I’ve been working in a combination of things like brand management and advertising and a little bit at a design firm. I ended up coming across David Allen and his work because way back when I was a brand manager at the Clorox company working on Glad plastic wrap, believe it or not. I had a review one year that didn’t go so well, it was okay but the worst little check box was an area called planning and organizing on my review. So I needed help and my boss said ‘hey why don’t you go find somebody to help you get better at that and it turned out that David Allen was doing seminars and trainings at Clorox. I met him there and then I ended up getting coached by Kathryn Allen – his wife and Co-CEO and several years later after a little bit of career wandering and soul searching I realized that coaching was the right thing to do for me and more of why I was here in the world.', 'So, what I always recommend is the ideal would be 90 minutes. People are busy. And that 90 minutes kind of a check-in, “Let’s just go around the circle. How is everybody doing? What’s your wins and what’s your challenges?” And then sometimes people say, “Well, I want to study a book from John Maxwell, or Brene Brown, or Jim Collins, or something,” and they’ll tell you a chapter of the book, and that’s fine. And then people will also say, “I’d like to talk about it but I’d like to talk about what I’m learning.” So, it’s what’s called the content piece. You’ve got the check-in, “How’s everybody doing? Do you have a content piece?”', 'Right. So, another one, and this is another one that’s, I think, not widely appreciated but is super powerful. It’s what is known as retrieval. And so, there is a really interesting study done by Jeffrey Karpicke and Janell Blunt where they took students and divided them up into different groups. And one of the groups they got to do what they called repeated reviews. That means that you have a text or you have some material that you’re studying, and you just read it over and over again. And this is very similar to how a lot of students study, they take their notes and just read them over and over again as they’re preparing for a test.', 'Yeah. One, I think it was the one that was probably the most pleasantly surprising to me that it worked frankly. I joke about this with Francesca Gino at Harvard and Dan Cable, who is at London Business School now, although all three of us were at University of North Carolina at the time.', 'Well that’s so good, thank you. Well, you tell me, Jolene, is there anything in sort of this last minute here so, that you’d like to convey before we shift gears and talk about a few of your favorite things.', 'Yes. I think that’s good and important, and it kind of reminds me a little bit of is it Odysseus who strapped himself up so that he could hear the Siren song, but not be lead into their temptations that would annihilate him.', 'Oh, thank you. And I’m thinking about killing with kindness. I mean, we had a previous guest, her name is Maura Sweeney, and she told an amazing story of someone who just really talked trash about her up and down, like all across the different people. And so she summoned that person, said, “Hey, you know, I think I owe you an apology. I had no idea that you had these concerns with me and my approach and my leadership style. And I want to apologize that I don’t know what it is I did that made you feel like you couldn’t share that with me directly. But I want you to know that you can and I care about what you think and I want to make this a good environment.” And so he must’ve just, his skin was crawling, like, “Aargh!” And it turned it around real quick.', 'The thing that you referred to in terms of fasting is, Cliff Saper did some interesting research up at Harvard looking at what happens when you fast a rat. And so what happens is we have this circadian rhythm kind of sits in our suprachiasmatic nucleus in our brain. And so if everything is working well that’s our timekeeper, kind of tell us what to do. Now, if all of a sudden, we stopped eating, your brain starts to panic a little bit and say, “You know what, it’s not a great idea for us to go to bed now since we haven’t eaten in a while.”', 'Well, thank you. And how about is there a particular sort of original Linda quote that seems to really connect and resonate when you’re sharing it with audiences?', 'The credibility I have, Pete, as a leader is that I’m successful. Do you think somebody wants to follow me if I’m not successful? Whoever gets up and says, “Wow, gosh I’m not doing well financially. I’ve got to go find somebody that’s gone bankrupt a couple times and get some advice from him” No, the first thing we turn to is we turn to somebody that has done it well. We teach what we know, but we reproduce what we are. We turn to that person.', 'I have a lot of fun ones. They say that women are not as empowered as men in the workforce, and I say, “You know what? When I started my agency, we had so many women in our agency we had enough estrogen to make Arnold Schwarzenegger ovulate.” Women power.', 'Scott Young', 'There’s lots of ways. My telephone number is 203-948-7029. That phone lives with me, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You can text me and email me on that phone. I have a website, which is a very important website in crises – one of the most important around – it’s www.e911.com. You can catch me on the web, I’m on LinkedIn. It’s pretty easy to find me, if you Google me right now there’s about 78,000 entries that pop up when you Google James E. Lukaszewski. So, I should be findable.', 'MEMZY.com, M-E-M-Z-Y, and the Twitter handler is @areyoumemorable, and of course LinkedIn Carmen Simon. I’d love to stay in touch and I would want to hear what is your 10% message that you want to put on other people’s minds.', 'Yeah, I would invite and challenge business leaders to rethink how you are about your relationships and not to shame yourself because you might need to have a friend. We try to be so strong, we try to be Superman, we try to be Wonder Woman, but the reality is all the neuroscience says, “You need people just like they need you.” And I promise you, when you say to some people, “Can we make lunch about me? I just got a challenge.” It can’t be anybody.', 'Alright. And, Tony, if folks want to learn more or get in touch, where would you point them?', 'Some people toss it and leave it but you pull up quick to retrieve it, is what I’m summarizing. See, I’m retrieving it right now, Scott, and connecting to rap music from my youth. Well, that’s intriguing. So, then to do the free retrieval or what do you call it?', 'In fact, I worked with Ken Blanchard, who wrote The One-Minute Manager, for ten years. He used to say the leading style of management in America is – he called it ‘leave alone, zap.” We leave people. We don’t give them great direction or tools or support, but we let them have it when they make a mistake. We zap them and then we keep going back. We hardly ever use the tools that most drive, most pull the performance and those are the positive consequences, which are all around us every day.', 'Oh, yes. I’ve read that in Robert Cialdini’s book, “Influence.” And it’s fascinating. All those pieces of research he drops there, like the eye-popping transformation in kind of yes rates. “Because I need to make some copies.” That’s kind of understood. That’s why we’re all here. But that alone will do it.', 'Once you share that idea with that friend, if they look at you like, “Michael, this is really stupid. I have no idea what you’re talking about,” well, you might just be wrong and you might just decide that it’s time to shut it down. But if they’re excited about it, then our next step, what we talk about a lot is, go follow the energy.', 'All right. Well, Bob, thank you so much for taking this time. There is just tons of just wonderful gems of insight like I think that there will really be real human beings who can take this and just know how to be a lifesaver in terms of the daily experience of work. So thank you for enriching us in that way and keep on doing what you’re doing.', 'Oh sure. There are three dimensions of trust. We often refer to them as the three C’s because all three dimensions begin with the letter C. The first is trust of character. What that means, Pete, in our relationships with one another, we build the trust of our character when we do what we say we are going to do. We keep our commitments, we honor our agreements and we all understand what is expected of one another. When those behaviors are in place, we’re building that trust of character.', 'Kim Powell', 'Well, Joe, tell me. We’ve gone at a rapid pace here. Folks who are accustomed to listen to their podcast at 1 ½ speed probably had to bring it back down to 1. So thanks for bringing it. Tell me, is there anything you wanted to make sure to mention before we shift gears and hear about a few of your favorite things?', 'Then I said, “No, now Gail, really honestly, I do think I could win 100-yard race with you if I had an 80-yard head start.” And she goes, “Oh, well, shoot, yeah. Okay, yeah. Hello.” Now to be honest with you, I really wanted to say 70 yards, but I wasn’t sure I could do it with 70. I thought, eh, no, but 80 I could kind of roll across the line. I think I could do that. Of course, then we all had a good laugh.', 'Oh, fun. Thank you. Well, Linda, do you have a final parting call to action or a challenge for those seeking to be more awesome at their jobs?', 'Scott, thanks so much for joining us here on the How to be Awesome at Your Job podcast.', 'I really think that one by Cynthia Bourgeault is compelling to me. “What the caterpillar calls disaster, the master calls a butterfly.”', 'You know, I’m reminded of the oddest things sometimes in the podcast interviews, and now I’m thinking about an old Dane Cook, a comedian, joke about someone in the bad romantic relationship, and her friends are saying, “You should just get out. You should just get out of there. You just get out. Just go.” And she’s like, “Well, it’s not that simple, Karen. My CDs are in his truck.” And I just think there’s so much truth to that. Like, “Yeah, there’s a few changes that have to happen, and that’s hard to do.”', 'Drew Geant', 'I’m curious when it comes to say petting the dog, is there a certain dosage. Like if I were to take a break and hang out with my precious baby Jonathan, just how much touch kind of releases a dose?', 'Now, so since we last spoke you started your own company, you’ve gone solo. It’s kind of like Justin Bieber or something, out of NSYNC. You got your own company now, it’s MEMZY. And what’s MEMZY all about?', 'Jolene Blackbourn', 'Dr. Janice Presser', 'Okay. Well, Jolene, thanks so much and good luck to you. This has been fun.', 'Mike Marquardt', 'Now because who’s got more energy for an idea than the person who came up with it to begin with. Now Sally may come at it differently than the last person that tried it two years ago. She might do an internet search. She might check with a dozen friends at other companies, “How do you guys handle this?” Who knows what she’s going to do? But she might come back and from her energy and her research do something that does work.', 'Remember that connection is potent. Whether or not you’re in a relationship, there are many ways you can release feel-good neurotransmitters. I’m releasing oxytocin just by petting Rocco right now, my little rescue – my tough guy who I rescued from South Central LA. It’s just – it’s amazing there are natural strategies we can use each and every moment.', 'So, if I’ve got somebody coming in and they’re, I don’t know, complaining or negative or whatever, and I give them 45 minutes that I don’t have, well, I tolerated that so I got it. But if I say, “I only got three minutes here, or five minutes, or whatever,” or I even have a tougher conversation. You know, Henry Cloud and I wrote a book called How to Have That Difficult Conversation You’ve Been Avoiding, that sometimes we could say, “I don’t have a lot of time. Sorry. I’ve got to get back to work.” Sometimes we have to say, “Can we really talk about this because there’s some things going on? And you can give me any feedback you need to but some things that are difficult that I want to talk about,” and you head to talking.', 'It shouldn’t be something where you’ve got to sneak out to your car and do it. You want to be in a place where you foster a supportive and sort of a sharing environment where if you’re not sleeping well, you’re having trouble with sleepiness, it’s not looked at as a weakness any more than if you had a headache or, God forbid, somebody in your office had a seizure. These are all medical things. And the person who has a seizure doesn’t mean he’s weak. It just means he’s got some electrical instability in his brain and we need to talk about it and figure out ways he or she can fix it, and move on with our lives.', 'Ed Catmull, cofounder of Pixar talks about this in his book about we have to reframe how we think about mistakes, that mistakes aren’t unexpected, mistakes aren’t something rare. Mistakes are just a part of a process and that we have to sort of grow comfortable with them.', 'The other thing, the other tool is explaining things to people who are not necessarily from that discipline and making sure they understand it.

If I can get her to understand that the Broglie wavelength and why physical things have a wave-like characteristic, then that means I understand it because she has no clue.', 'Michael J Arena', 'Ellen Ruppel Shell', 'In the book, I even go into cases like Bernie Madoff. He actually had three people whose job it was to make these fraudulent financial transactions that would supposedly fit the claimed returns.

This has been a lot of fun, and I’m certain I’ve got some takeaways, and I think everyone else did too. So, I wish you tons of luck in the crises and all that you’re up to here!', 'And I’m intrigued when you say you’re basically consulting your gut, and when you say affection, respect and pride. I’d like to get your sense, sort of deep inside your internal dialogue, Tony, what does it sound like when you ask yourself this question, you’re consulting your gut, and you hear a positive response or a negative response. Are you kind of imagining yourself in a certain context and them embarrassing you, or you’re just going, “Yeah, this guy rocks”? What is sort of that internal dialogue sound like for you?', 'So there’s all kinds of interesting little light manipulations you can do. There’s all kinds of websites that you could go on then. There’s this really cool device called Re-Timer. It’s made in Australia. It’s these little goggles that make you look like Tron. You put them on, they shine up blue-green light back into your eyes. If you go on their website you can actually enter in, “Okay, I’m going to New Zealand. I’m going to take the Lord of the Rings tour. I’ll leave in seven days. I’m really excited about it because I’m a huge Tolkien fan and you’re whatever.” And you can actually plug in your travel dates and it’ll tell you, “Okay, well, we want you to use these goggles at these various times and the days leading up to your travel to help prepare you.” So those are very important things you can do.', 'The priming, it means I’m thinking about it and I recognize it. I guess I’m wondering about sort of the value or importance we ascribe to something like you mentioned Khloe Kardashian. If we hear about the Kardashians a lot, I think some people tend to think that the Kardashians matter when in fact they don’t. Well, all people matter, but you know. I mean like on the stage of human events and things like that.', 'So it is interesting. So there’s a great book, it even has a clean name called Radical Candor. I don’t know if you’ve heard of this book, it’s by a woman named Kim Scott.', 'Dr. Bob, thanks so much for joining us here on the How to be Awesome at Your Job podcast.', 'It’s great to be with you. Thank you Pete.', 'Well, that’s a tough one because I have so many. Looking at my library here, I’ve got a huge number of books and I’m going to have to buy a new bookshelf pretty soon. One I sometimes face is Herman Melville’s The Confidence-Man. It’s not one of the most popular Melville’s but I always found it quite intriguing. It’s kind of an allegory about how everyone is sort of an unreliable narrator, and you see a lot of parallels in life. It’s funny too, so it’s quite a good book.', 'Michael. P. Dolan', 'That was my biggest gig. Jennifer Anniston is the face of Aveeno. I guess for a brief period of time, I was the hands.', 'Joe, thanks so much for joining us here on the How to be Awesome at Your Job podcast.', 'And the trick is, is that Benjamin Franklin got the guy to do a favor for him. And then there’s a bunch of research on cognitive dissonance, cognitive consistency. Some of your listeners may have heard of this in the introduction to psychology, that the notion that I’m doing a favor for you, yet I don’t like you, it’s hard to align those things. So the more favors that somebody does for you, the more they’re going to like you. So this trick, and it is sort of a trick, but getting other people to help you, who are not being nice to you, is another way to sort of bring them around on your side.', 'Often, I refer to one of the great questioners of all time – Albert Einstein. He had this one question, “What is the relationship between energy, mass, and speed?” That was a great question. Once you have a great question, it’s only a matter of time. Either you, or people around you, will be able to answer that question. If you look at the history of inventions – all the great inventions in the history of the world – was because the inventor asked a question that no one had asked before, or had heard a question that no one had asked before. When you’re solving a problem, oftentimes it’s a question that you’ve merged as a group that’s understanding the problem. They ask something that connects things that they’d never connected before. “How can we connect point-A with point-B?” Where normally you never even look at those two divergent perspectives.', 'Because people do make mistakes. People do take risks that are unwarranted. But what I’ve learned, I guess, Pete, and to kind of put it into a few bite-sized chunks, is I’ve learned something called Four Rules of Flight. And if you look at it from a business perspective, there are a certain number of rules that would relate to if you were flying a plane. So as an example, the four rules in flight are weight, lift, thrust, and drag.', 'Well we are a bargain Pete, because you know …', 'It said, basically a passage says, the people didn’t understand what had happened, but it said the servants knew. Well, the reason they knew is because they were in the act of obedience of putting the water in the buckets or in the jars. The point being, Pete, it’s very simple. Obedience is never understood on the frontend; it’s always understood on the backend.', 'So, I think that we can quickly recognize, “Okay, I’m not going to die but something else really bad that I don’t want to happen can happen.” So, in the mental gymnastics of that sort of, “How does Ed fight back?”', 'There’s a couple that come to mind. I’m a huge fan of Covey, and his fifth habit, “Seek first to understand and then to be understood,” is probably one of my favorites that I use in my work. There’s a quote from Tiffany Dufu from the White House Project. She and I were on a panel many years ago, and she said that there was a poster in her office that said, “If things are getting easier, you might be going downhill.” And that really stuck with me.', 'And little tips along that, one of the things is embrace boredom. We are at our most creative when we’re not at our phones. We’re way too addicted, of course, to the data coming in. It’s an addiction that goes to the dopamine centers in our brain, so we want more and more of it. And it stifles creativity because… I mean, we interviewed the editor of the cartoons for The New Yorker, Bobby Mankoff, who is also a friend of my husband’s, and he said boredom is great. That’s when you get a lot of your ideas for cartoons, because what happens mentally is when there’s nothing going on, the brain has to fill up this space, so you make all these weird synaptic connections. It’s the reason that you have ideas in the shower, you have ideas when you’re walking down the street.', 'Bill, thanks so much for appearing here on the How to Be Awesome at Your Job Podcast.', 'Yeah. One that jumped out at me from a young age and has stuck with me. It’s actually the quote I use in the conclusion. It’s a long one, but it’s from Merlin in The Once and Future King. It’s basically him kind of reflecting on the power of learning. I apologize for the length, but I think it’s worth it.', 'Yeah. The whole premise of the book is that humans basically are incapable of being unpredictable. It’s very hard to do that even when you try. How this book actually started, I went to MIT where there was the very famous mathematician Claude Shannon there. He was still a professor at the time I was there actually, and he created this legendary machine known as the outguessing machine. He called it actually a mind-reading machine.', 'Dr. Richard Shuster', 'I am really a big fan of waking up early, and not so early that like I’m not one of those guys that’s up at like I’m referring to Jocko Willink. But he’s always up and he flashes his watch, and I’m like, “Man, thank goodness you are protecting our country, man, because I love getting up early but I could never do it.” But I do like to beat the sun up. That’s like my goal no matter what time of year it is because I really think there’s something magical about those hours.', 'W. Chris Winter', 'Again, this whole networking space, I studied a lot of network theory. I guess the one that just jumps out at me right off the bat is a professor over at University of Michigan, Wayne Baker, a good friend of mine, went out and studied – we didn’t even talk about this – but went out and studied energizers and people who bring energy into an organization, which is one of the core network roles that I talk a lot about.', 'But the fact is that, the bottom line of the book is this: There is no such thing as a table; the table is a myth. It’s still there, it’s widely thought about, but it’s a myth for several important reasons. One is, no senior official I’ve ever worked for made a decision based on a gang of people in a room shouting out ideas for solving problems. You watch any meeting, senior people, and when their meeting breaks up, the boss will say, “Hey, Mary? You’ve got a minute? Stay back a second.” “Tom, you got a second?” That’s when the real meeting is going to start. Not with the 29 consultants who were in the room, and the 16 lawyers.', 'A couple that I’ve been thinking about that apply to my work and I read a lot. I read a lot of fiction as well. But Daniel Pink’s Drive is something that has really resonated with me. Just thinking about as a coach, as someone who’s trying to teach and motivate people and even motivating a small child has a lot of really interesting insights about what motivates people and why people do what they do.', 'But to learn and see someone like David who has that deep spiritual commitment inside of his life and to see that there’s a way to express that commitment through seemingly non-spiritual work in the world. As a coach now I do some work around work for coaching a lot of what I learnt from David but a lot of my work, it sounds similar to you, is around general leadership development and one on one coaching and as a coach I personally also have a pretty deep spiritual practice and community. I have a deep sense of why I’m here on the planet and what’s important and it’s not that I necessarily bring that conversation up every time I’m talking to an HR Director who’s considering hiring me for coaching but to know that the working I’m doing that might be very kind of block and tackle skills based. It’s still about helping other human beings, being more fully expressed on the planet and also helping myself get out of my own way to do the same. So David was definitely an inspiration regarding that.', 'That’s what you get with Michael Dolan.', 'Mike, thanks so much for joining us here on the “How to Be Awesome at Your Job” podcast.', 'A favorite book. I’ve got a lot of them. As a doctor I always liked House of God by Samuel Shem. It was a book that I read when I was an undergraduate before I went into medical school. And then I read it as at some point after I went through residency. It was like a completely different book. It was the book that St. Elsewhere, the TV show, many years ago with Denzel Washington I think got his start in television, it was based on. So I always liked that book.', 'Well, I’m super excited to be having this conversation. You’ve got so many interesting books and we’re going to zero in on the latest, but first I wanted to note, Wikipedia informs me that your cousin is Paula Poundstone.', 'Pam, thanks for joining us here on the How to be Awesome at Your Job podcast.', 'Pam, thank you so much for joining us here on the How to be Awesome at Your Job podcast.', 'And we’ve branched out probably since you spoke with Randy, so a good, I would say half, 60% of our business is that core helping on key talent decisions. And the rest we branched out to do more broader leadership development, CEO succession, I do quite a bit of my work in the private equity space, supporting on human capital diligence prior to deal close. So we’ve certainly grown a little bit, I think, since episode 30.', 'One of the things in the book – one more thing Pete and I’ll shut up – one of the things in the book that I really am glad I addressed was this issue of uncertainty because a lot of people say, “Well, I want to be certain before make that move or make that decision.” I talk about the fact that’s not possible and that leaders, the best leader shift leaders, they’re very comfortable with uncertainty.', 'Beautiful. Well, Pam, thank you so much for taking this time and sharing these perspectives. I wish you and Big Interview and all you’re up to lots of luck.', 'When I did my research in the building of The Center for Creative Leadership, I went to the best leaders in the top organizations. I went to these people and I said, “What are the questions you ask? And when do you ask them? And how do you ask them? And for what purposes?” And so forth. It reconfirmed what The Center of Creative Leadership and many other folks have stated over the years. One of the quotes I like to use frequently is one by Peter Drucker, who is considered one of the top management theorists over the past fifty years. He passed away a couple of years ago. He said, “The leader of the past was someone who made statements, who had the answers. The leader of the future is the one who has the questions.” You cannot be a great leader – or even a good leader in today’s environment – if you do not know how to ask great questions.', 'My favorite quote is from Gandhi, “Be the change you want to see in the world.”', 'Yeah. A very recent one actually. There was a study by McKenzie, that looked at the matrix, which is an area I’m spending a lot of work on at the time, and very often the matrix gets a bit of a bad press in the literature, because it is more complex and it does have some challenges. What the McKenzie showed was that the more people were matrixed, the higher their level of engagement, which kind of reinforces the point I’ve been making for some years, that there are some benefits in this. People kind of like the complexity, and the freedom, and the scope that that gives them, and so there are advantages to complexity as well as costs.', 'Walter Mischel, yeah.', 'Thanks for inviting me, Pete.', 'Almost every weekend, we have our friends Paul and Diane over, and we make a meal with them, and we play a board game. And even though we have kids, and they don’t have kids, we do that almost every weekend if we can. And that’s just a very centering thing for me to just have time that I’m not looking at a screen and that I’m hanging out with friends.', 'Yeah. I used to do some competitive motor sport. I used to drive rally cars, again, back to my obsession around speed. One of my favorite quotes is from Mario Andretti, who was one of the world’s most successful racing drivers in all kinds of different formulas. He said, “If you feel like you’re in control, you just aren’t going fast enough.”', 'That’s what has to happen, and while you’re at it, through the phone number on it, and then if you have two minutes and a phone you know, you can pull it off and get it done. So that’s so good, is that it’s not just follow up with a Rick.', 'It’s great to be here and great to talk to you, Pete.', 'We interviewed Haskell Wexler who just passed away last year. He was considered one of the best cinematographers of the 20th-21st century. And we interviewed him because he’s an Oscar winner, so famous, so many incredible movies. But we interviewed him because we thought he had this amazing weakness, struggle, and that was the fact that he was born colorblind. Can you imagine, Pete, somebody wanting to become a cinematographer if they are colorblind?', 'So, people hear me talk, and I’ve had people come up to me at conventions and say, “What you’re saying is great and all, but I’m in my job and it’s a good job. I’m looking for fulfillment, but I’ve got two kids and I don’t want to start my own business”, or something like that. And so what I would say to people who are thinking that, listening to us talk, Pete, is that there are a lot of different ways to find fulfillment. And that’s why knowing what you’re passionate about matters. You can keep your day job and you don’t have to, at the age of 40, quit and go back to graduate school to become a counsellor. You can volunteer at boys’ and girls’ club or something like that.

And I like the way you phrased that question. That came up when we talked to Randy Street, “What will they say when we call them?” is good because it sort of naturally gets a bit more honesty from them, like, “Oh, they’re going to call them. I better tell them what they’re really going to hear.”', 'That’s like, make sure Rick sent the proposal or whatever that specific things is, so you don’t have to pull the paper up again or even do a search in your digital files.

And Sean, for those of you who aren’t familiar with him, was voted as one of the eight most inspirational people alive. I think he won the ESPN award for courage as well. And Sean’s story was so powerful, because basically he did at two different points in his life contract two extraordinarily rare cancers. I don’t remember the number he gave on the show of the odds of getting both of these different types of terminal cancers, but the odds were like winning the lottery, a gazillion times. It was a ridiculous, an impossible number.', 'Right. We’re done. Now she’s going to check her brains at the door. How about saying, “Well Sally, that’s an interesting idea. Why don’t you check into that and see what you come up with?” What did that cost you?', 'Oh, I love it. Joe, this has been a real treat. Thank you for this, and good luck in all you’re up to.', 'Well, I like that so much. Yes, it’s really resonating with that option perspective because it’s sort of… It almost turns me off if I’m in charge, I run my own business so I get to call the shots and stuff so… If I’m in charge and then someone tells me what I should or have to be doing, with Instagram or whatever, I already don’t like it. Even if they’re dead right, I already got my guard up, whereas if you showed me those options, like, “Pete, there are 5 great ways that you might want to consider promoting your podcast. One is through social media like Instagram…”', 'Got it. Well, Ellen, tell me anything else you want to make sure to mention before we shift gears and hear about some of your favorite things.', 'Yeah, totally. That’s cool. In the workplace then, it’s intriguing. So in giving, you are not only just being helpful, and maybe a listening reciprocation, although I guess it’s a little bit debated whether if you fixate on that, that you may be shooting yourself in the foot, in terms of the biochemical benefits flow into you. But when you do so, you’re feeling awesome, and so that has all kinds of cool follow-on effects in terms of being able to be happy, more productive and cheerful and energetic and creative, and all that sort of stuff. I’m thinking about Shawn Achor’s Happiness Advantage stuff here. So that’s cool. Then how else do you think about giving in the realm of relationships and networks and colleagues and collaboration?

You do want to be an executive, right? And they’re going to decide you’re not worth it.', 'And it’s just that process of learning to talk about that engagement at a deep level. And as you do that, people are kind of learning new muscles, learning to practice in a little bit more concrete way, versus, as you jokingly said, Pete, but it’s the truth.

Of course, this is thirty years ago. I was not the liberated male I needed to be. She said, “I would like to be a medical doctor.” I said, “Eveline, we’ve got four little kids. Being a doctor, and going to medical school, is going to be very difficult. I’m making enough money. We don’t need to have the money,” but she said, “No, I want to be a medical doctor.” She had to overcome my resistance, in a sense. She was a woman, married with four children in 1980.

We certainly were not more talented than any of the other agencies out there that are filled to the rafters with incredibly talented people. What we did realize is that we just worked our tails off more than any other people in the other agencies.

Some of my researches on organizational chain and scaling, that one of the most astounding stories I’ve ever read is called The Path Between the Seas, it’s by David McCullough, the famous historian. It’s about the building of the Panama Canal. One of the most amazing stories of what it takes to get something really, really hard done under difficult situations, just a beautifully-told story. So those are completely different books. One is about how to survive as a creative individual, and the other thing is how to do innovation with the most massive possible scale for the time building the Panama Canal was just astounding.', 'I start with kids with ‘What did you love?” because they always know that because they feel that emotionally. But ‘What did you learn?’ and it’s just phenomenal because, you see, experience is not the best teacher, Pete. You hear it all the time. People say, “Oh, experience is the best teacher,” but it’s not. It really isn’t. If experience were the best teacher, then as people get older, they’d all get better.', 'All right. Scott, this has been a lot of fun. Enjoy your learning.', 'We wrote another book years ago called “The Power of Small,” and John Wooden, a famous coach, said, “The most important things, of all the most important things I teach my players, is the first thing I teach them is how to put their socks on,” because wrinkled socks will irritate your foot and then you can’t play. And so it comes down to these sort of small little tidbits.', 'He was part of the HarvardNegotiation Project, he wrote some books on negotiating. It’s I think his latest book or if not it’s one of the later books from him and in your question inherently there is in any kind of re-negotiation of commitment there is a no that has to happen either to our self or to another person. What he talks about in that book is we all have our different patterns and different shenanigans that go on inside of us when we have to say no and what he offers as a practice and a solution is to become more and more conscious in those moments of what am I saying yes to in this moment instead of this thing that I’m saying no to. For instance my son really wants to go play on that piece of equipment at the park that I see as a little bit sketchy and he really, really wants to and then part of me, the old nice parent who wants to be the buddy wants to say yes but I say you know Maxwell I care so much about your safety that I don’t think that’s a good idea. No can’t do that.', 'Dr. Mike, thanks so much for joining us here on the How to be Awesome at Your Job podcast.', 'My website is www.kaplanthalerproductions.com. And Thaler is spelled… it’s a weird name. T-H-A-L-E-R. And you can get a look at all of our books and just stuff I’ve done over the years. And a way to contact me, and I’m not shy, I’ll give you out my email address. It’s linda@thalerproductions.com. Again, I don’t work in advertising anymore because I love speaking about topics like this and I speak all over the world now. I’m happy to speak to a company, to a non-profit, and many colleges. I love speaking at colleges.', 'Yeah, sure. I mean, talking about guts, I think Winston Churchill says, “Guts is holding on to fear a minute longer.” Longer than you think you can. We’re talking about try anything new, different, audacious. The stuff that really moves you ahead in life is scary. And we said it’s kind of like walking a tightrope without a safety net. So I went a little further and said, “Let’s interview somebody who actually walks a tightrope for a living.”', 'It is. So Dr. John Gottman who is a marriage researcher…', 'In fact Karen Martin, who you had on the show a we days ago talked about this. She said people who act like they know everything and know all the answers or think they do is actually a form of arrogance.', 'Oh I love it. Kevin, this has been so fun and helpful for me, and hopefully all the listeners as well. I wish you tons of luck, and success, and smooth travels as you’re gallivanting across the globe here.', 'That is cool. And so, speaking of experience, you’ve got loads of it over at ghSMART. And we interviewed a colleague of yours, Randy Street, from there, way back in episode 30. So for those who are newer listeners and didn’t catch that one, what is your company all about?', 'Bob, thanks so much for joining us here on the How To Be Awesome At Your Job podcast.', 'We have people like Tristan de Montebello who is actually someone that I met before he did his ultralearning project, and he did want to get really good at public speaking. And over the course of seven months, he went from having about zero experience, just then having a handful of speeches in his entire life, to being a finalist for the world championship of public speaking through a process of doing lots and lots of speeches, but also getting feedback, videotaping his performance, seeking all sorts of unique ways to improve his skills.', 'Oh yeah. We had Dan Cable. Keep going.', 'Another thing a little bit deeper that still I think has a big impact on me that I learned from working there and working for him is David is someone with a very deep sense of spiritual purpose, a very deep spiritual practice and you wouldn’t necessarily hear that because he doesn’t necessarily talk about that directly.', 'Trust those lists and that calendar when you want to know what should I do right now. Nothing’s new about that and David did a great job of articulating the truth of that. There’s some folks out there who say ‘well you know David’s Getting Things Done approach doesn’t make sense anymore because we’re in a modern world’ and I have to call bullshit on that because the fundamental nature of what he said will never change if human beings always have more to do than time to do it in.', 'Dr. Bob Nelson', 'All right. Pam, this has been so much fun. Thank you for sharing this and bringing yourself. It’s just been a lot of fun, a lot of enrichment, and I appreciate the time.', 'Babe Ruth said? “Yesterday’s home run won’t win today’s game.” I find that very true. Whatever I was doing yesterday, I’m glad that I could do it, hope I did it well, but that really doesn’t mean that I can do the same thing today.', 'Well, I’m a big fan of Edith Wharton, and I love— I love, love, love Age of Innocence, which is her masterpiece, I think. So it’s kind of an indictment of society at the time for being estranged from its from its culture, right? And, you know, I think we have a lot to learn today from that, you know, being estranged from culture and being focused on on sort of material world can be quite, quite problematic. So, I think Age of Innocence, I would have to say.', 'Tony Tjan', 'Yeah. The one that I probably get quoted the most back is something that Dave Upton told me. Dave was a great mentor. One day I was going to meet with him. We had 30 minutes. Time was tight. I probably had an hour and a half of material that I wanted to cover with him. As an operations scholar I could do the math there. Clearly the way to solve that problem was just to talk three times as fast.', 'When they reach the age of 18 months or 20 months, they are now able to verbalize what was going on in their subconscious. They start to continually ask questions, because they love to ask questions. They ask great questions. Then their parents tell them, “Stop asking so many questions. You’re driving me crazy. I don’t have time.” The teachers tell them to stop asking questions. Most children – and this is a global phenomena – they all love to ask questions as soon as they can start speaking. Within three to six months, they stop asking questions because parents say they don’t have time for them. They’re stupid questions. You’re embarrassing our Uncle Joe, or whatever.', 'Michelle, thanks so much for being here on the How to be Awesome at Your Job podcast.', 'A couple of the practices to get very precise with you is there are times where you need to create discovery networks. A discovery network is a network that’s actually going outside of the insular walls of an organization and finding out what the customers of tomorrow really need and want, like the Maven story I shared with you a few moments ago.', 'All right. Well, tell me, Janice, anything else you want to make sure to mention before we hear about some of your favorite things?', 'Alright. Well, Tony, thank you so much for sharing this. It’s been really cool to get a perspective from someone who have venture capital and goodness combined. It’s been a real treat and I wish you tons of luck with your investments and your people imprinting and all you’re up to.', 'Yeah, so the Feynman Technique was a sort of idea that I kind of pieced together from reading smatterings of Richard Feynman’s autobiography where he talks about some of his processes that he used to learn things. Now, it’s probably not the case that he used exactly this method, but he did seem to use similar cognitive processes in the work he was doing so I called it the Feynman Technique sort of after my inspiration from him.', 'So, good stuff. I’m with you there. So, being awesome at your job has benefits that extend beyond just a good review and maybe a pay raise or a promotion. That’s cool. And so, I’m curious, in the realm of helping – when you’re helping other folks, I guess I’m thinking about the Adam Grant Give and Take stuff. How do you think about that, with, sort of, your mission about changing the world and making it a better place, with more helping and becoming the best version of yourselves, and then doing these acts of kindness? How do you think about in the grand scheme of, you’ve got your resources, your time, your energy, your attention, how you spend your day. And how do you think about the allocation of, “Am I giving or am I taking? And am I giving to just anybody or am I giving strategically? Or is giving strategically really self-serving and not truly giving, and thus I don’t get the cool brain benefits?” I just want to enter this messy tangle with you.', 'Bob Sutton', 'The leader, the leadership team, and eventually engaged all members within this very large plant, they went to work on strengthening their relationships and building trust and connecting trust building to expectations and performance and standards and how they worked together. To make a very long story short, a year and a half later, Pete, they had moved from the lowest producer in that twelve plant network to the number one producer in that twelve plant network. It’s an example of what happens when trust is present. Everybody rises to their highest level. There’s that jazz, there’s that vibe, there’s that can do attitude that just produces very significant results. When trust is vulnerable or broken, that lowest common denominator becomes the norm, everything becomes harder and results do suffer.', 'Absolutely. That’s the Franklin quote. Isn’t it Franklin about “Better to stay silent rather than reveal our ignorance,” basically? Staying silent gives us a chance to think and the often avoid ignorance in the first place.', 'Kevan, thanks so much for being here on the How To Be Awesome At Your Job podcast.', 'Okay. Strong endorsement there. Cool. I think I’m recalling, Davis back in episode 7 did some work with the forum corporation and kind of determined that in fact, organizations who want to sort of go fast in terms of get a lot of stuff done and produce a lot of output really did have high trust and had to invest in getting there first. Is there data and research along those lines that you’re well familiar with?', 'A book lately that I’ve been liking and recommending a lot is a book called The Fifteen Commitments of Conscious Leadership by Diana Chapman and Jim Dethmer. I really like their bold approach at really going for it in terms of if we’re talking about really wanting to be conscious human beings who get stuff done in businesses.', 'So the idea behind the 24-by-3 rule was taught by a mentor of mine, Jay Chiat, who always had a capacity to see the goodness in anyone’s idea. So here’s how it works. The next time you hear an idea from a colleague or a friend, can you wait 24 seconds before critiquing it in any way, shape or form? And if you can wait 24 seconds, can you actually pause for 24 minutes to think about the positive attributes about it? And if you get past 24 minutes, is it possible for you to think for the next 24 hours all the reasons why that idea might work before allowing yourself to think about any reason why it will not work?', 'I would have to say “The One Thing.” I interviewed Jay Papasan on my podcast, and just such an awesome approach to focusing on the thing that’s really going to make everything easier. That’s my go-to.', 'Mamie Stewart', 'In fact, I … all the time, because I get some push back on this from kind of choleric-type top-down leaders. They say, “John, when you start asking questions, you give up control.” I say, “No, no, you don’t understand. When you start asking questions you’re in total control because you’re in control of the questions you’re asking.”', 'Michael P. Dolan', 'I appreciate it, Pete. Thank you. It’s been great to be with you.', 'The person on the call said, “John, what does that theme mean to you?” I said, “Well, let me just tell you what each word means to me. When I think of fast, it means to me, when I think about today it’s fast is faster. Faster, it’s faster than it’s ever been before. … I’m just going to hold for a while and wait until things kind of slow down and make sense actually.” I said, “I’m sorry. You’re going to have to die for that to happen. It just isn’t going to be there.”', 'So, one of the things that’s been very helpful for me is, I remember – I’m sure the audience remembers when those bracelets came out that everybody started wearing – WWJD, I think they were called. And it was like a reminder, kind of like this string around your finger to act in a certain way. And for me the thing that I kind of asked myself, which is my ONE thing – to talk about Geoff Woods here a little bit – I try and act in a way that all of my actions in some way can help other people, even if it’s of no benefit to me directly.', 'Okay. Well, Tony, this is so much good stuff. Tell me, is there anything else you want to make sure to mention before we hear about some of your favorite things?', 'Yes. Well, that’s a great question. It’s very on point because the forward for my book is done by Dr. Marshall Goldsmith, who’s the – considered the number one coach in the world. What he wrote about was who owns engagement.', 'Well, we’re glad to have you. And speaking of great guests and hosting them, I noticed in your Twitter feed that you recently hosted Isaac Lidsky, whom we had earlier, amazing, amazing inspiring guy, back in Episode 142, at your On Cue event. Tell me, what’s that event and how did Isaac do?', 'So we interviewed Nik Wallenda. He’s from the Wallenda Aerialist Family. And if you might remember, Nik Wallenda walked across the Grand Canyon a few years ago without a safety net. And we interviewed him, not while he was walking across the Grand Canyon, but we interviewed him afterwards. And I said, “You must be nuts. You have a wife. You have two little kids. Why would you take your life in your hands?” and he said, “Nah, that was pretty much a cakewalk for me.”', 'Thanks Pete. I’m looking forward to this.', 'One of my heroes, Becky Margiotta, who is one of the heroes in one of the chapters, she went on, besides being in special operations, to lead something called the 100,000 Homes Campaign that found homes for more than 100,000 homeless American. She did great things. But she had to get through some really difficult times.', 'Lovely. We’ll do that. Mike, this has been so fun. Thank you for this. I wish you tons of luck in all of your travels, consulting, and helping people come up with better questions.', 'Yeah. Paul and Diane, they will find these new games and then we’ll play them. It’s so fun.', 'And so, by doing that, he is accelerating his process but he’s also making sure that when he does learn something, it’s going to be used immediately. And, obviously, the examples I already brought up about Eric Barone learning video game development often through working on his own video game, or Tristan de Montebello learning public speaking by doing these speeches, this is sort of in contrast to how we often think about the kind of sit and listen model of lectures and classes, which is so typical to our normal education process.', 'Awesome. Well, Michael this has been a lot of fun. Thanks so much for sharing the good word. I wish you and GM lots of luck in all you’re up to.', 'Hi, Pete. Thanks so much for having me.', 'You’re winning already. I’m just thrilled. I loved that you asked me that. You did your research. Yes, I was a hand model. Everybody’s probably thinking – well, everybody old enough is probably thinking of the Seinfeld episode when George was a hand model.', 'Oh, I thought of Gottman.', 'That’s great. Thank you. Brad tell me, is there anything else you really think is important to mention before we shift gears and hear about some of you favorite things?', 'At the time a bunch of my work had been kind of learning by doing, experimental learning. It was clear that that wasn’t going to move the needle enough, so I kind of gave a, “Well, hold on. Let me think about it. We’ll go back.” I spent that 20 hour flight back reflecting. Dan and Fran and I kind of came together to brainstorm.', 'Pete, it is awesome to be at the Awesome At Your Job podcast. Thanks for having me.', 'Beautiful. Well, Kim, this has been a lot of fun. Thank you for sharing these research insights, and good luck with all you’re up to, and have fun over the next recharge period!', 'In fact, I think the greatest detriment, Pete, to a person’s success is or the greatest detriment to tomorrow’s success is today’s success. The moment I kind of get settled in today and kind of say, “Oh, I’ve got this for me. I’m going to hold on to it. I want to keep it,” it’s just not going to happen. It just doesn’t happen that way, especially in the times we live right now. With social media there’s such an incredible awareness that’s happening.', 'And it’s also, it’s also good. That also remind me back in Episode 23 Michael Kerr was talking about having a Humor for his aid kits for, but now you also have a Praise for this aid kit. If you’re like, “No one appreciates me in this job and it sucks and rrrrhh.”', 'It’s been a pleasure, Pete. Thank you. I appreciate it.', 'And these are some dramatic examples, but a lot of the ways that I think this practice of ultralearning can impact your life are things that they may not be going to be bestselling novels, but they are things that really matter to the person who did them. So, people like Dinah Feisenfeld was another woman that I met in the process of doing this, who was a librarian. She was reaching near the end of her career, and she was facing the fact that the world doesn’t need as many librarians as they used to, and it’s a struggling field with budget cutbacks and stuff.', 'You know, it’s interesting. It’s funny as a podcaster. I think before I was a podcaster, people have said that just the way I talk and articulate myself is just different. And it’s like my word choice and I guess cadence is just different. Some people might think that’s odd, like “Is this guy for real?” And some people might think, “Oh, this is so fun and just engaging to listen to.” But I think that is a unique charm. Hopefully, it’s charming in many contexts. But there are other times when it’s happened to me with that. It’s like I’m in a meeting and they say, “Okay, Pete, this is just too much energy and peculiarity for this early in the morning for us.”', 'Their first step was to learn about trust conceptually, was to get on the same page in terms of what it meant. They learned a model of trust. We have a model of trust that’s called the three dimensions of trust. They learned a model of trust and equipped themselves with a language to be able to talk about trust. They learned core behaviors that built trust and then they took the bold step, Pete, of actually assessing how they were practicing those behaviors with one another. That requires quite a bit of courage to take the concepts of trust and lift them off the pages and put them into action and take a courageous honest assessment of how we are practicing these behaviors in our work with one another.', 'Excellent. And, Joe, is there a final challenge or call to action you’d issue to folks seeking to be awesome at their jobs?', 'One of the things – when I do my workshop, I like to give the story of Einstein. They say he was a great questioner. We are all born great questioners. Einstein was a great questioner. He also played the violin, and he taught children how to play the violin. The folks around Einstein said, “Albert, you’re a genius. Why are you wasting your time teaching children how to play the violin? You should be in your laboratory coming up with some great theories.” Albert Einstein said, “It’s not a waste of time. The reason why I like to teach children how to play the violin, is because they ask such great questions.” Einstein said that the main difference between him and other scientists and physicists and so-forth, is that he could still ask questions like a child.', 'Okay. Now I’m thinking about, I’ve been here several times myself, as well as others. In a previous interview we had with Claire Patel about rising like a star, she was given a choice by her manager, and she said, “Okay, well I got some resources available for you to expand your team and you can have either one person in the United States, or two people in India,” and it’s funny because some people would say, “I want one person in the United States,” because there’s a bit of miscommunication, difficulties, assumptions, cultural stuff, educational, learning differences. I, several times, have given some instructions to folks helping me out on things in the Philippines, and by golly, it just didn’t come out the way I thought it would when it was returned to me, and it’s like, “What’s the holdup? What should we do in terms of maximizing the clarity in that particular two way streaks of kind of west to developing outsourced country?”', 'I had a wonderful friend, Pat Summitt, who passed away a couple years ago, but she was the University of Tennessee lady volunteer basketball coach and I think the most successful women’s coach ever in basketball, college basketball. I think she had over 1,000 wins. But she was an amazing woman, an amazing leader and an amazing person.', 'Oh absolutely, it’s so exciting the stuff with oxytocin. We had Paul Zak, a big researcher in the field back in episode 124 and it’s so huge.', 'Thanks, Pete. This was great.', 'Oh, perfect. Thank you. Well, Bob, tell me, if folks want to learn more or get in touch, where would you point them?', 'Carmen, welcome back to the How to Be Awesome at Your Job podcast.', 'And that’s a concept called assuming positive intent. And so whatever it is that other people might be like, “Yeah, that one is for you, Michelle.” Instead of me focusing on what people might be doing wrong, what I actually will focus on is the idea that we all rush to judgment.', 'Well, that’s a good time. When I was a child, I had two gerbils and one of them I named after Paula Poundstone, so that was named Paula.', 'And every morning when you wake up you sit next to that light box, check your email, lots and lots of light in your face in the morning.

Like you’re not tripping over stuff and falling down but it’s dark. Dim and dark and moody.', 'After the press conference Pat and I went out to dinner. I said, “Pat,” I said, “that was an amazing exercise.” I said, “Talk to me about it.” Here’s what she told me, she said, “John, my first year and a half as a coach I was not a good coach and my teams were not successful.” She said, “I kept asking myself, okay, what am I missing?” She said, “I just knew that there was something that was obvious that I was missing as a coach to help me out.”', 'And you think you’re making sense because you’re like, “I’m so mad at you,” and you just aren’t. And actually, the Gottmans figured out that one of the quickest ways to reduce your beats per minute and get that oxygen back into your body is to read a magazine because it’s really hard to read a magazine and to also be mad at another person because your brain can’t really keep track of all those different things. The worst thing is to take a break, go for a walk, and then keep mulling it over. You can go for a walk, but you don’t want to keep mulling over the frustrating situation with your boss or with your spouse or with whoever it is that you’re frustrated with.', 'It’s not Jack Welch.', 'Sometimes that idea can come from the newest person on the team, the person that isn’t biased by all the policies we have and how we’ve been doing it for years and “I’m just wondering, why don’t we try this?” Well, you take that person, new person, any person and you say, “Well, Sally, let me tell you why we don’t do that. We tried it two years ago. It didn’t work. It won’t work now.” “Oh, okay, I’m sorry. Sorry for – it won’t happen again.”', 'I had another episode that I recently recorded.

And shared his story about how he inspires others.', 'Thank you, Pete. I’m glad to be on.', 'Yeah, so one of the tools and frameworks I said, and I should’ve credited, I think, a combination of a couple of my mentors from . . . who was the people development person for McKinsey, Deepak Chopra and my partner Mats Lederhausen gave me that five-part mentoring framework. I use that very often as a tool. And from a physical standpoint, I’m old-school Boy Scout. I think a little penknife always get you out of a lot of trouble.', 'But I guess maybe speaking up at a meeting in which you share an idea that might be dumb or wrong or bad in some way is probably a prime time to amp up a little bit of risk and see what happens because you might say, “Wow, Brad, we’ve been waiting for this brilliance from you.” Thank you so much. It’s well worth doing with low down side.', 'In terms of the three top practices to heal your brain, I love, and this is a chapter in my book, it has a sort of a funny – I actually got to – I don’t know if any of your listeners got to see it. This episode aired recently and hopefully it will replay and people can Google this, but I got to hypnotize Dr. Oz on his show.', 'Yeah.

Well, Dr. Richard, this has been a blast. Thanks so much for taking this time and doing all you do with the helping!', 'But it turns out, research tells us that when we ask other people questions, it’s not that they thing we’re dumb, “I can’t believe Brad had to ask me a question,” they actually like it. It shows engagement with them and it also allows us to turn to who we all think the expert is going to be, which is ourselves. We engage that other person in the conversation.', 'Sure. Sure, I’d love to. A story that initially comes to my mind when you asked that question is a story of a team that runs the operation center for a very large global airline. At the time that I first met them, the team had a very significant IT initiative that was dramatically behind schedule and when something like that is behind schedule it has some pretty significant cost implications and the team, they were just stuck, Pete. They were not operating at their best level. Every single person of the team was highly skillful and capable and talented, but when they came together they were having a hard time collaborating and working in alignment. Rather than functioning at their highest level of capability that the lowest common denominator had become the norm.', 'And, Tony, tell me, is there a particular nugget or piece that you share that seems to really connect and resonate with people, a Tony-original quote that gets the job done?', 'Well, yeah, it’s funny when you talk about you’re feeling sort of under-resourced, tapped out, you’re less likely to act compassionately that reminds me of the study of the seminarians who had to turn in a paper. I believe it was about the story of the Good Samaritan. Half of them were told that they were late. The other half was not. I imagine you’ve encountered this in your work.', 'I think one of the studies I like the most is Angela Duckworth studying the West Point cadets and finding that the ones that were most able to get through the grueling West Point process, and she’s sort of the founder of this whole grit movement, are the ones that were motivated by intrinsic rather than extrinsic goals. The people who made it through were the ones who were less worried about recognition and status, but whose main impetus was to serve their country. And so I think you all have to look in the mirror and go, “What is my purpose?” If it’s just profit-driven, it’s going to be hard to accomplish it. But if there’s a purpose attached to it, it’s going to be far easier.', 'He grabs your arm and you walk over to that window and he tells you the story of that view. That’s a minute and a half. You’ve only got 15. And once you start on the first window, you have to go to the second window. So that’s another minute and a half, he tells the story. He’s done this a million times. So you get to the third window; my brain is saying, “Jim, Jim, say something that matters, because the next wall has the door.” Which it did.', 'Very good. Tell me, Pam, anything else you want to make sure to mention before we shift gears and hear about some of your favorite things.', 'I think that’s interesting. A lot of research backs up the fact that just the practice, the doing it, of putting yourself out there, may be you won’t be Picasso, but it’s a way of learning and a way of pushing yourself.', 'Yeah. Boy, this reminds me of when I first learned how to podcast. I hunkered down with Pat Flynn’s YouTube videos, which were amazing, and I was like, “All right. Tell me what I’m doing. All right, now, I’m going to do it.” It’s like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom and it was pretty fun and rewarding because, to go from, “I have no idea what I’m doing,” to, “Okay, that’s what the guy said I was supposed to do,” to, “Oh, hey, I just did it. All right. What’s next? How do I get this RSS feed business going? All right. Let’s bring that out.” And so, it did really reinforce in such that it became second nature in a hurry.', 'Another one that is interesting, Pete, and I spent my first half of my career as a clinical psychologist and then now as a leadership coach, or running a leadership coaching organization. One of the other things that I see as a theme is that change is hard for all of us. That to make a change, even what might seem like a small change, takes a lot of conscious effort, and that is part of what makes coaching valuable, to have someone walking alongside you and helping to look at how you can build some practices and continue to make some shifts that are really going to matter for you.', 'And something else she was good at too because I would come in and I would be all excited about stuff I’d need to have done and “Katie, can you do this?” She would listen and she goes, “Bob, I’d be delighted to do that. Let me show you what I’m working on now. You let me know which you prefer to have me do.” Then she would – I kind of, “Hm, okay.” Then she’d show me.

And Isaac, as you know, who was your guest, Episode 142, spoke on that theme as only he can do so well around, “What is the reality that you create for yourself?”', 'The way to demonstrate how that works – if, for example Pete, say we were at a cocktail party two weeks ago and we met this morning, and I said, “Pete, can you think of the name of that person that we met at that cocktail party two weeks ago?” Neither of us can think of it. You can’t think of the person’s name, and we continue our conversation. Ten minutes later, you say, “Oh yes! I remember! That was Joe Smith! Or Ernie Ernesto, or whatever.” I say, “How could you – ?” We were busy talking, but your subconscious was searching for the answer, so if you ask yourself – you prep yourself with questions, your subconscious will help your body, your skills, and so-forth emerge. That’s a very powerful technique, and it’s very simple to do.', 'I think that for any artist, for a record producer, a song producer, a book producer, you take your bestselling product – or for any company, if any – I was just talking with Garry Ridge, CEO of WD-40. They’ve got a fantastic product. It’s a 500 million dollar company. They’re in 300 countries.', 'Drew, thanks so much for joining us here on the How to be Awesome at Your Job podcast.', 'Dr. Jones, thanks so much for joining us here on the How to be Awesome at Your Job podcast.', 'Oh wow. That’s great. The strange thing is Paula’s sister, Peggy, was actually named after a dog that her father had. I guess kind of runs in the family there.', 'I’m researching the competitors on addictive app best practices. Cool. Well, Shawn, tell me, anything else you want to make sure to mention before we shift gears and hear about some of your favorite things?', 'Thank you, Pete. I appreciate being with you.', 'The cardinal rule in escalating in the matrix is escalate up all the legs of the matrix at the same time. If you just go to boss A, they will explain to you how their 20 hours is a priority, and so will boss B, and so will boss C. It doesn’t help. What you might have to get is at least two or maybe three of those people in the room together to thrash that issue out.', 'Second thing, so I’m going to go opposite. Now, by the reverse, let’s say I’m trying to manage up and I’ve got a boss who’s not very motivated by power. If you’re working in customer service, particularly in a call center, that may be true for you. So, I want to go in with the reverse. For instance, something like, and I can’t even say, Pete, because it’s very unlike you, but let’s say, “Joe, I’ve been giving this some thought and I’m wondering if this might be a very effective way to do things and I’m going to give you a chart with maybe a few bullet points or something. And I’m going to be very happy if you adopt it for your own.”', 'A favorite book. I’ve been really enamored with historical biographies. I would say that Washington Irving wrote a biography of George Washington that was thoroughly researched. Part of it is how well it is written and the fact that Irving knew contemporaries of George Washington that were amazing.', 'So then we started looking at people who were hugely successful famous people, and what made them so extraordinary was how completely ordinary they were growing up. Colin Powell, C minus student all through college, until he discovered his passion for the military, for ROTC. Steven Spielberg, three times he tried to get into film school. They didn’t think he had enough of a gift. Michael Jordan (and this was surprising to me) couldn’t even make his high school varsity basketball team because they didn’t think he had enough physical prowess. Jack Ma of Alibaba, when he graduated from college, he was considered such a low potential that he couldn’t even get a job as a server at KFC.', 'And my thoughts then shifted to my parents, my mom in particular. I was young and I wasn’t married, and I was like, “My mom’s about to get this call that her son is dead.” And I was so guilty. What a senseless way to die. And then the next thought that I had, which kind of came out of that guilt about my parents was, “What do I have to show? What have I really accomplished in my life? What am I proud of? What are people going to be proud of me for?” And the answer was, “Not much.” And then obviously I didn’t die. It took me quite a long time to recover, but for me, Pete, nothing was ever the same after that.', 'The third one is deliver reality. And reality means sometimes we don’t need just people being present with us, or people just encouraging us. We also need like a Yoda, somebody to say, “Hey, why is that happening? Let me tell you some research I saw and here’s some information. Kind of give me the data.” Sometimes we do need data, wisdom, insight, perspective from somebody that really has been down there, and is a deeper person, like Simon Sinek’s great TED Talk about the power of why. People can help us with the why that we’re having some challenge.', 'Well, Ellen, this has been a real treat. Thanks so much. And good luck with your teaching and your writing and your travels and adventures.', 'Well, Pam, this is so much good stuff. I want to make sure that we don’t have an uber long episode in responding to my listener feedback. So, tell me, is there anything else you really think is important for professionals to know about your world of coaching expertise before we shift gears and hear about some of your favorite things?', 'Then when they hear or see something about a good job that was done, they act on that thought. They don’t make a mental note, “Oh Jerry did it again. He’s one of my best people.” They actually say something to Jerry or bring it up at the meeting or jot him a note or an email. They do something to connect back with the person that did the performance.', 'That’s so Meta.', 'So, one of the examples of an ultralearner I talk about in the book is Benny Lewis who’s learned dozens of languages. And his approach for learning languages is to start having little conversations with a phrase book, or Google translate or something like that, from the very first day he starts learning it. And this is in contrast to how we often think about language learning where you get some big book and you work through a bunch of exercises, and maybe you spend months without having a real conversation with someone.', 'Jolene, thanks so much for joining us here on the How To Be Awesome at Your Job podcast.', 'Thanks a lot, Pete. It was really fun.', 'I love Facebook. I do a lot of Facebook lives because I love long form. I do a lot of 20-minute videos, like backstage from the doctors and Dr. Oz. I do a lot of stuff on Facebook, so I’ll go to my Facebook page or DrMikeDow.com.', 'But it was authentic. No one walked in wondering what the experience was going to be like. And I remember reading an article that the founder and owner at the time of Whole Foods, said he met with Jeff Bezos, and we’re excited to come aboard. And he said, “Really, the difference I learned from Jeff and his company, was that I cared too much about people.” And I thought, “Dude, you have it totally wrong. You just you had it on a bunch of posters that you cared about people; you didn’t actually care about people.” And I’ll give you one more example of that exact lesson, I was running a publicly traded company.', 'Perhaps I’ll just talk a little about systems, and we can have some fun with that. The notion that in the work of coaching and leading, to have a sense of our boundaries, how permeable our boundaries are, what happens when they’re too tight or when they’re too porous? I have a wonderful friend, Pat Adson, who talks about this metaphor that goes like this. Imagine that we both have a garden, and your garden has a fence around it and a gate, as does mine. Yours has weeds, flowers, vegetables, as does mine. And that I look at your garden, without asking permission, I walk in your garden and I start doing your weeding for you. I have now lost my boundary, and I’m lost in your story.', 'That is a great distinction not to confuse effort with results. I remember my buddy Ronny when he was doing some intense football training. He even wrote in huge letters “Effort equals results.” That might be true in the sense of if you push yourself harder in a physical training endeavor, so long as you recover wisely, then maybe effort equals results. But in sort of knowledge work, effort may or may not equal results and it may equal a smidge of results or 20 times that more per hour.', 'Carmen Simon', 'One is giving and receiving feedback is critical. It has to be direct, timely, and actionable. Another thing we talk a lot about and Karen Martin, who was on the show the other day, mentioned this – sort of the inverse of what we talked about.', 'Okay, excellent. Well now, Kim, can you share with us a favorite quote, something you find inspiring?', 'I’ll say, “Okay, when your time with Pete and the listeners today, what do are you taking out of that, that 45-minute experience? What do you glean out of that, Maxwell?” Again, evaluating, reflection, asking questions.', 'But I eventually went back to it and wrote this book in part because I had thought so much and had answered so many emails, and still I get probably an email a day still from somebody who sends me their story about the jerk they’re dealing with, and they ask for help. And I didn’t mean to become the Dear Abbey of the jerk world, but here I am. And so it’s been an odd life.', 'I was working with Johnsonville Food, the maker of great brats up in Wisconsin. They’re CEO, Ralph Stayer, told me that he had his admin once say, “Mr. Stayer” this was back a few years ago. She said, “We have such a great products. I’ve always wondered why we don’t market those more online.”', 'The first step is to grow in our own awareness and to reflect on our own behavior and to consider and honestly check in with our selves. How is my behavior aligned with trust building? How am I managing my agreements when I commit to something and I am not able to deliver how do I respond? Do I pick up the phone and call the individual and say, “Hey, I got thrown a curve ball and I’m behind schedule. I know I promised to get this to you by 5:00 and I’m having a hard time making that. Can we renegotiate?” How honest are we in terms of expectations and in terms of what others are expecting of us and what they can expect from us. There is that aspect of how it begins with us, Pete, and our own awareness and our own behavior. That’s the first place that I would encourage people to go.', 'Part of my difficulty was that – and I think the difficulty with burnout for a lot of people is that it’s a very disorienting experience, so it becomes troublesome to try to figure out why you’re not feeling quite right and what’s going on. Actually it was the assistance of my wife, Evelyn, who nudged me to get some help and to look into things. That sort of took me down the road of getting some outpatient intensive psychotherapy.', 'Awesome, Pete.', 'But of those surprises this was least surprising. I think his name is Richard Foster of Yale, he did a piece of work that showed the lifespan of leading companies has shrunk to less than half. I think it was from 60-something years to 20-something years over the last couple of decades. Just the pace of what is happening in the market right now demands a level of adaptation that just wasn’t there for the prior generation.', 'And I constantly praise people to the management. Again, it keeps a positive rapport throughout the office, it also makes them more likely praise you. So if somebody helped me “Hey, I you know, why can’t we stick ahead a leave, I have a hearing in the afternoon I couldn’t go, and to pick up my kid,” this person at the last minute agree to take that hearing for me so I can go and pickup my kid, you know, that’s a praising well. And then, they’ll remember “Hey, Jolene jumped in and helped me with my thing” and they’ll reciprocate instead of just it being between the two of us, it’s now between us and the management.', 'Kevan Hall:', 'And I loved working for David at the company, I was there for about five or six years. For me it was the first time in my working life that I felt like I was just completely being me and doing what was natural as opposed to playing a role or making things up or posing as somebody I wasn’t. So that was a huge relief for me and David himself I have an immense amount of respect for. I think he’s a pretty amazing man. Some key things I’ve learned from him there, the first as you might guess from knowing about Getting Things Done his approach is just his sense of integrity. This is definitely a man who walks his talk and follows through on his commitments and is honest when he can’t and I learned a lot about that from him.', 'Brad, thanks so much for joining us here on the How to Be Awesome At Your Job podcast.', 'We had Kim on the show.', 'This commissioner, then said, “Why didn’t you say something, or ask a question to the other members of the group – what happens if the ship hits this big of an iceberg at this angle?” No one asked that question, and the reason is one of the great fears we have in life, is the fear of asking a dumb question because we’ll lose respect of the people around us. They’ll say, “Who let Mike into our group? We thought he was a pretty bright person, a pretty skilled engineer or whatever.” It’s safer not to ask a difficult or risky question, so we don’t. That’s why this question, “Does anyone have a question that we’ve not yet asked?” That might be the question that might save the organization or save 1,400 lives.', 'Like so and so was very pleased and said “Wow! Jolene, you blew my mind!” or whatever.', 'But doing the best we can to mitigate the things we know that organizationally cause stress because Christina Maslach, who’s done as much work on burnout at a corporate level than anyone, with Michael Leiter wrote a book in 1997 called The Truth About Burnout: How Organizations Cause Personal Stress and What to Do About It.', 'All right. Well, Janice, this has been a lot of fun. Please keep up the great work.', 'Now is that – I think I’m getting that mixed up with the Jack Welch book. Is that-?', 'Is that Josh Waitzkin?', 'That reminds me. One of my favorite work moments, it was so short, but I remember I was working on a consulting engagement and then someone said something. I don’t remember what they said. Then the manager said, “Hm,” and then there was just like silence for about ten seconds. Then they prompted her like, “Steph?” She’s like, “I’m thinking.”', 'And I said, “Joe, she’s right.” I mean, the way the neuroscience works. It says we got to have more people in our tank. And I said, “You know, your spouse is a little overwhelmed. She’s a nice person but she’s not everything. And, by the way, your dog is genetically engineered to lick your face and be nice to you because he won’t eat otherwise so you need more.”', 'James E. Lukaszewski', 'So, if your boss is very high in power, and, Pete, I’m going to make the assumption you are because if you weren’t wanting to be instrumental in this world, you never would’ve started a podcast, or been a great consultant, or anything else that you do. So, how I’m going to approach you is, even though I’m normally a real power person, I’m going to go in very low in power, and I’m going to say something like, “You know, Pete, I’ve been trying to solve this customer problem, and I just need to ask your help.”', 'Okay. Well, that sounds exciting to me. And so I’m intrigued though, venture capital is a place where maybe we don’t think about that so much. And I guess I’m thinking about the movie Wall Street, Gordon Gekko, “Greed is good,” or, “Cash is king,” and, “It’s called the bottom line for a reason,” etcetera. So while I like the feel good stuff, could you make the data-driven case for us about goodness as it relates to economic value?', 'So, I don’t know if there’s a favorite quote I have per se. I would say the Jim Rohn quote is one that always resonates strongly with me, and it’s, “You’re the average of the five people that you hang around with.” And I know that’s been overused in this space, but I want to qualify as to why, in that one of the things that we’ve discovered in recent years are these little guys up in our brains called “mirror neurons”.', 'Pete, that’s actually a pretty easy one.', 'Here comes Pat into the locker room, goes straight to the marker board, looks at what did we do right, what did we do wrong, what do we need to change, made a couple comments, not very many, maybe a minute or two, just a couple comments, affirmed what they were thinking, and maybe tweaked them if they weren’t or maybe if they missed something. Out on the floor they went and played the second half.', 'I think the idea that we all are attracted to the beautiful things in life and what beauty means to each of us is different. One example of that is if you look at the Renaissance masters, the early Renaissance masters, their idea of beauty was perfection. Nicholas Poussin, if you look at his paintings, there’s no dirt, there’s no grime – everyone is perfect.', 'Thanks, Pete.', 'But the character and integrity of George Washington is absolutely outstanding in reading the book and the kind of man he was and the kind of – the way he comported himself in different situations, absolutely courageous, was spellbinding for me.', 'Yeah, they say this Lombardi, of course, the great Super Bowl coach of the Packers, they say what he would bring all these pros together for their first practice at the beginning of the season. The first thing he did is hold up a football and he’d look at these pros. Now think about it. They played high school. They played colleges. Their pros. They’re the best in the profession.', 'Beautiful. Well, John, this has been a real treat. Thanks so much for all you’re doing in the world. It’s greatly appreciated. I hope that Leadershift is another hit. Just keep on rocking.', 'Yeah I go right back to what David articulated in Getting Things Done because I think he really boiled it down to the truth of human beings and human being who have more to do than time to do it in and what needs to happen to alleviate that. The basics are stop keeping anything in your head about any open loops of stuff you’ve got your attention on. Decide what it means to you sooner rather than later. Park the results of that thinking in a place outside of your head that you can trust and keep current and review easily and review and refresh that system regularly because it ain’t going to clean itself up and then trust that all that great work that you keep on doing to feed that external system.', 'Well, again, that varies tremendously with the kind of job you have and the kind of person you are, most essentially the kind of person you are. So I mentioned I interviewed a lot of social scientists and management scholars, and among these was a wonderful scholar at Yale University. Her name is Amy Wrzesniewski, and she’s done some amazing work on work and jobs.', 'Well, you have a fun history and you’ve written a lot of catchy jingles that folks are familiar with, whether it’s the Toys R Us kid or the Herbal Essences’ “Yes, yes, yes!” or others. So I just would love to hear from you. What’s a little bit of the behind the scenes and how these things come about? Because my imagination is just like Jim Gaffigan’s little Hot Pockets bit, which is like “What have you got for us? Hot Pocket.” That’s perfect. Is that how it goes? How does this work?', 'And Jeff Bezos at Amazon, he left his cushy job in Wall Street. Nobody thought… Don’t ask friends or loved ones, “Should you take that leap into that new career?” because they want you to be safe. Jeff Bezos finally talked to the one person who gave him the best piece of advice, and that was his 90-year-old self. And he turned to his imaginary 90-year-old self, and the 90-year-old person looked back at him and said, “Do you really want to be this age, having never tried something that you were passionate about?”', 'And Mamie, tell me – if folks want to learn more or get in touch, where would you point them?', 'But the point of the book is this: There is this notion, this fallacy out there that there is a table somewhere that you’re trying to get to. You’ve heard this phrase, right: “I’ve got to get to the table.” Well, the people I work with, who 50% of what I do is with operating people, they know what I talk about ’cause their employees talk about it. And they always ask me this question, “Jim, where is this table you keep talking about? It isn’t anywhere near my office. And if I find this place, I have to go there. And Jim, if I go there, who’s going to be there?” And I said, “That’s easy. The same whiny internal voices you hear all the time.”', 'And so he actually did it and he’s a very happy person actually. He’s working about two days a workweek now. They live in New Zealand, and he’s raced two champions. He’s got three kids, and his kids are really good sailors. One of them was just on the New Zealand boat that won the America’s Cup, and the other one, the young woman, Alex, she just won a silver medal in the Olympics a year in 2016. So he’s raised really good sailors, but I really liked that notion that sometimes work is overrated.', 'So I’ll call out two. One is called NurtureShock – I think it’s by Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman – data-based research on parenting – so that could be up your alley. The other one, I have a 10-year old girl… There’s a great book called Untangled by Lisa Damour, who again – data-based research on how to navigate the teen years. And then I would say from a business perspective, I love (Growth) Mindset by Carol Dweck.', 'Pete, thanks for having me.', 'Ooh, a favorite book. I’ve got a list on my website of 12 favorite books, but we’re talking about the d.school so I’m going to pick a weird one. You mentioned Kim Scott’s Radical Candor. If you’re going to pick a relatively recent book, that’s my favorite book. But my favorite creativity book of all time, it’s called Orbiting the Giant Hairball, it’s written by this guy named Gordon Mackenzie, he passed away a few years ago. Gordon Mackenzie, his job was the creative paradox of Hallmark Cards. And what Orbiting the Giant Hairball is about is it’s about how to survive essentially a large organization where you’re the creative person and to survive it with some grace, some humanity, and to make it more creative.', 'Some of those quotes I’ve given you. I’ve found over life, the quotes about questions – I’ve given you the Einstein one, or Drucker. I read one just recently. Eric Schmidt, who was the CEO and now a chairman on the board of Google. He said, “We run this company through questions, not through answers.” You find all these people who said the power of questions. I like those kinds of quotes. You had another great management theorist who said that the main difference between a leader and a manager – a leader is the one who asks the right questions. The manager is the one who gets those questions answered. There have been a lot of great questions. The reason we’ve got McDonald’s is because Ray Kroc asked the question, “Where can I get a good hamburger on the road?”', 'And so, I remember talking with Tristan de Montebello, he was the guy with the public speaking project, and I remember him telling me, he’s like, “You know what, Scott, it’s not that I just got good at public speaking, that that was I was excited about, but that this totally changed how I will approach any project in my life in the future,” that just all these skills and things that he would like to learn just seem to open up in front of him, that he kind of considered before.', 'And the same thing happens when we have leaders who have A Type personalities who want to get it all done and who are used to accomplishing and feeling valuable through accomplishing and who have lots and lots and lots on their own lists and the first step often is being able to say no to themselves. To look at those things on their project list and have the awareness to feel wow, I am over my capacity, I have up until midnight for five nights in a row or a month in a row, I need something so I can have more balance and space. So in those cases it’s a I’m saying yes to my own health and balance and for me to be able to do the other stuff that is really important excellently and in order to do that I’ve got to say no to these things and it might be difficult conversations but it’s a no to myself first and then let me go have that conversation with Bob down the hall.', 'Often feedback is a big part of you can say practices. If I’m working with somebody on what I call Self Management really GTD practices the way David articulated them in Getting Things Done are a big part of how I do that with folks. So helping step by step, get somebody up and running with that approach. Re-emptying their head, going through all of their emails, going through all the stuff they have attention on and learning to keep it out of their head and decide about it sooner rather than later, keep it organized in a clean updated system and use all of that, all of those practices to help them make better choices about how they’re engaging, so GTD practices are often a baseline. Sometimes what I found and what seemed to have emerged is my unique positioning as a coach is that often leaders at a higher level are being called forth to really develop deeply as human beings, as leaders.', 'Well, differently for everyone. No cookie cutter as we both agreed. What you’re asking about really gets down to what happens in me as a human being when I need to make a request, when I need to say no, when I need to declare something that’s true for me despite however you might react, what I need to re-negotiate something. We all have different ways that we get in our own way when we’re interacting with other human beings about all of that kind of stuff. You know the book that comes to mind that I’ve enjoyed, a really simple book that I’ve passed onto clients who are maybe working on saying no is a book by William Ury called The Power of The Positive No.', 'One of my favorite quotes and this will get a little bit into the conflict thing is it’s a quote by Colonial Picq. This quote goes like this, “Five brave men, who do not know each other well, would not dare attack a lion.” I know that’s masculine, so I’ll pivot it in the next part of the quote. “But five lesser brave men or women would do so resolutely.” I think this is a team activity. What I’m talking about, you have to have friends. You have to find friends. You have to have people who are in it with you.', 'And my whole career, the one thing I wasn’t insecure about was surrounding myself with people who were smarter and more talented than me. It made my job so much easier. And when I first opened my agency, that was it. I was like, “Who can I find that’s smarter than me and more creative than me and writes better than me?” And I managed to convince these people to come on board. One of them was Robin Koval who was my business partner and also the co-author of all our books. And I knew right away.', 'Bill Poundstone', 'Beautiful. Thank you. Well, Michelle, this has been so much fun. Thanks so much for making the time, and I wish you tons of luck in your business, in your work, in helping to transform more and more folks. This has been a real treat.', 'I think that really helps because sometimes you can get carried away. People will come up and they’ll say something, “Oh Dr. Jones, you’re really going to be angry about this.” Before I even hear what the issue is, I’m already like, “Yeah, I’m going to be angry.” It sort of it helps to kind of take a breath and make sure that you’re being you and present in the moment.', 'So, a book I would recommend, which has been my favorite book for last year, is called The Enigma of Reason by Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber, and this book is basically challenging the idea of what we think we are doing when we are thinking and reasoning about things. And I found it to be a very interesting book because it explains so much of why we argue about things, and also how we can think smarter in our lives.', 'A couple that I’m crazy about recently, there’s a book Tasha Eurich wrote, INSIGHT—', 'I’m going to actually reference someone else’s work because why reinvent the wheel when someone else has such a great system for it? Have you heard of Byron Katie?', 'Yes. It was able to predict what people would do. When Shannon made this, he was working at Bell Labs. At the time Bell Labs was like Silicon Valley today. It was where all sorts of smart people were always coming in, kind of taking tours. This outguessing machine was like the sword in the stone. Everyone who came there who had some reputation for being smart was taken into this room and said you’ve got to play this machine if you’re so smart, and none of them could beat the machine. They all had these unconscious patterns and they were not able to be unpredictable.', 'Michael thanks so much for joining us here on the How to Be Awesome at Your Job Podcast.', 'So, one of the quotes, and I’m going to modify it a little bit because I really like it, but this is a quote from the motivational speaker Zig Ziglar, and he says, “Happiness is not pleasure. Happiness is victory.” And the thing that I’d like to modify it to is kind of really into what I was saying that I think that “Happiness is not pleasure. Happiness is the expansion of possibilities.” So, I do think that it is when we achieve things, it is when we expand, when we feel like we’re capable of that, we have our happy moments, not just when we get a reward or something nice happens.', 'But I mentioned trust as the first discipline because there are sometimes problems with trust. One of the most important questions I get asked by consultants at every level is, “Jim, I work for a guy who I trust; I think he’s honorable, I’ve learned a lot from him over time, but he has a habit that he pursues that I’m trying to change. I’ve been working on this for a long time. How do you do this? How do you walk in and talk to these people and get them to change?”', 'So there’s two or three things that I really look for or advice people. The first thing is the tendency might be to fight and argue back, but you might want to sort of look and see sort of it’s almost what resources you have to fight back with. One is old-fashioned power. Well, I was just thinking of my, what do you call, this guy, Paul Purcell who was CEO and is now Chairman of Baird. He’s CEO and he would tell people during job interviews, if he discovers they’re a jerk, he’s going to fire them. And he did fire people for that, right? So that’s the ultimate case, right? So you can actually get rid of them.', 'This is intriguing. So, let’s talk about each of those a bit. You mentioned they’re all buildable muscles. And recently we had Gary Burnison from Korn Ferry on the show, and I was so intrigued to get his take as I’m a kind of dork who will plum through their For Your Improvement competency matrix, and note that I’m so intrigued by how they’ve cataloged some competencies are much harder to develop than others. And I asked Gary to put a little bit of a context on that, and he said perhaps 200 times harder than others to develop. And so, I’d love to get your take on, when you talk about they’re buildable, but it’s challenging – just how challenging?', 'Linda Thaler', 'Oh, interesting. So, then, the key distinction there is that, you’re saying, be careful of causation and don’t sort of say it’s because of it, but share what happened. Let’s see, set me straight here, Carmen.', 'Well, the one that I did already mention I have to give credit to Adam Bryant who writes The Corner Office column for New York Times is, “What is that singular trait you would want to have from your mother or father and why?” You learn a lot about a person in that response, especially if you keep double-clicking and say, “Tell me more.” That would be the one that I think is really important.', 'But the way I got involved in this, somewhat accidentally, was in 2004. I was asked by the Harvard Business Review, Julia Kirby was the editor of that, and she said, “Could you write an essay on breakthrough ideas?” And I said, “Well, Julia, I have an idea for something I want to write about that I feel really strongly about.” It was in part, because in my academic department in those days we had a “no jerk rule,” and also at the time my wife was running a large law firm and dealing with jerks was a big part of her job, so I had this kind of going on in my head.', 'And if more people come to you for advice at some point, you don’t know everything, there’s nobody that knows everything, and so for example in my field, if there’s a claim that involves the death of somebody, I can say “Hey, I haven’t dealt with that but I know that Mike has and you should go talk to Mike.”', 'But if she goes, “Yeah, I guess I get that,” that means I did a good enough job of breaking things down. And I think that’s called the Feynman technique of explanation maybe. So, those are my two favorite tools – note cards and the Feynman technique. If it wasn’t for that, well, boxing, writing, physics, who knows where I would be. It’s helped me learn so much and I think it’s a very powerful tool for anyone who are looking to add new skills or develop or create something new in their lives.', 'Drinking Jack Bauer.', 'And, in the course of our research, we, in fact, validated that there are 10 ways, very general ways, and you do them in your own way, of course, that people contribute to the world. Some of us, and I suspect, Pete, you may be very similar to me in this, we like to work with ideas, big, long-range, huge ideas that might even change the world. And that’s a very different way of contributing to the world than, for instance, loving to organize it.', 'Oh man. We have in large letters on our office wall a quote from Benjamin Franklin that resonates a lot with me, which is “Investment in knowledge pays the highest return.” Obviously we like to think that is true because that’s what our customers are investing in.', 'Oh, now, Carmen, I love it when you drop a number. That’s intriguing. So, 600 to 900 words is a sweet spot there. We’re talking about memory and stories and memorability and this good stuff. Are there any other kind of key rules of thumb or numbers that leap to mind?', 'Yes, so this wonderful woman, Wendy Palmer, who wrote a book called Leadership Embodiment, and she says, “The way we sit and stand changes the way we think and feel.” And I love that. The notion that, back to our earlier stories, that if living in my family was smartest for me to play it small, and I bring this all the way into my adult years, and I want to have, people often talking leadership development, about executive presence, and yet my chest is a little caved in, and I’m just not showing up as fully there, and strong, and standing tall, and taking up all of my space. They are embodiment, our ability to embody that which we are as coach or leader is a powerful source of strength for us and a way to center ourselves.', 'Is – well, I really do. I tell people all the time, well, a whole bunch of it’s me because I’m human and so even though I have a great desire to hear from him, I don’t say that I don’t have a lot of John in that thought pattern.

You got the answer, Drew? You’re going to lay it on us?', 'She’s basically a presidential scholar. She spent her whole life studying presidents of the United States. She wrote a Team of Rivals about Lincoln and she’s written one on Kennedy, one on FDR, one on LBJ, one on Teddy Roosevelt. I consume all of them. But this one is she took Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, LBJ and Lincoln and basically wrote a book on how they lived during turbulent times. It’s a fabulous read. I’m loving it.', 'What’s so crazy, after my first book was – I got a very sizeable advance and it was a very huge bomb. Then my second book was – I had to take – it was very hard for any – my lit agent said, “Mike, it’s going to be really hard for me to get any publisher to take a chance on you after the huge disaster that was your first book, but I’ll try.”', 'I am too and it’s so fun. So I see that you were working at the David Allen Company and David Allen was so awesome as to have a chat with us back in episode fifteen and more than once I’ve had friends just bump into job postings from the David Allen Company and send to me like ‘hey this sounds like you would love this kind of thing’. So I would love to hear about your experience. What are some things you’ve learned from working in that industry and from David himself and that whole experience?', 'But the vast majority of kids with problems are not the ones that are acting out behaviorally. They’re silent, and they sit in their classroom and they wonder why their classmates are so much better at the things that they can’t do. And they are the ones who are at increased risk for things like depression and low self-esteem. And there’s nobody in this space, Pete.', 'A little anecdote is when Thomas Edison was inventing the light bulb, when he tried to solve a problem, he would hold these ball bearings and he would take a nap.

Well, Dr. Bob, thank you so much for taking this time and sharing the goods.', 'Yeah, or you can have sympathy for the devil. Like I think the teacher, but they have a terrible wife and I can’t really blame them, or I forgive them. And I’m thinking back to your director, because although they may be nasty, the old notion that where there’s a poop there’s a pony, the old Ronald Reagan line.

She had read a lot of my books and she wanted to ask some questions about leadership. We were having a good discussion.

I think you’ve gone from a 100 to at least 50. I think it’s a big gain by really taking advantage of things to minimize that light in your face. And then trying to do something, and then the content of what you’re watching too. Instead of watching something about North Korea’s nuclear capabilities, it’s not a matter of if they strike the United States, but when. That’s probably not something great to watch. How about a documentary on Spandau Ballet. There you go. That’s a perfect thing to watch before you go to bed. There was some new romantic music as you fall asleep.', 'There you go. There you go.

He had a quote. He said basically all we’ve got is conversations. Let’s start to impact those conversations. Let’s start having different conversations and not ones where we’re complaining and griping about management and politicking.', 'The other element to reliable delivery is, I think more the mundane one, which is these leaders try to show up consistently and build consistent expectations into their organization, and this removes ambiguity. So for people who are operating day-to-day, if you are working for a leader who you don’t know, “Is Jekyll or Hyde is going to show up today?, “Is your expectation to the questions you ask of my P&L going to be different than they have been the last month?” – it is hard to operate affectively.

Like four – five, something like that?', 'Then I had John Wooden as a mentor. He was a phenomenal teacher and probably as just a quote an unofficial mentor, Pete, he probably taught me more than anyone else. He taught me about when opportunity comes, it’s too late to prepare and just how to always be ready for that moment. Make every day your masterpiece. It just goes on and on. He was a phenomenal mentor.', 'And prior to that car accident, prior to that day, I was very, very selfish, I was very materialistic. I would refer to my business as “The Schuster Empire”.

Yeah, as we get a little older I think there’s a general shift to being more advanced. Meaning that maybe when you’re young, 5 or 6 o’clock is your peak. Maybe when you’re retired and living in Sarasota, Florida maybe it’s 3. So there’s a general movement from the college night owl person to being sort of, “Yeah, we’re living in Brockworth Town and we get up at 3:00 o’clock in the morning, get our vitamins out and we’re on the golf course at 6:00. We’re watching MacNeil and Lehrer and go to bed at 7:00 o’clock at night.” It’s kind of like, “Where’d grandma and grandpa go.” “Oh, they went to bed.” And we’re like, “God, the sun haven’t gone down yet.”', 'I guess in the last couple years books that I’ve read, the one that jumps out the most is Adam Grant’s Give and Take, like givers and takers. His whole philosophy, if you haven’t read it, is that long-term, givers, people who are constantly helping, supporting and lifting each other up are the winners in the long-term game. It’s a phenomenal book.', 'Okay, that’s cool. I’ve been dying to – this is sort of fun – to get your take on this because back in the day, previous podcast guest, Muhammed Mekki, brilliant guy.

We got to talking one day and ended up creating this little offering and company we called Tutor Trail.', 'Now, why I like this is that this quote has been so often attributed incorrectly to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, that I found that fourteen percent of Americans now believe that Goebbels said it, even though he didn’t.', 'I’m a grandfather now, and I have eight grandchildren. One of the most important things in my life, as a grandfather, is to undo the damage that my children do to my grandchildren. I tell my grandchildren, “Grandpa loves questions. You can ask Grandpa anything.” They come up to Grandpa and say, “Why is your beard white?” Or “Why don’t the clouds fall?” Because they love to ask questions and I don’t want my children to destroy or limit that great love of questions. In my belief, the most important skill of life, that will make you a great person and a great success, is asking questions.', 'Well, that is much, much tougher because there are just many, but alluded to Benjamin Franklin’s diary. I think it’s very, very powerful and I think that many classic books on leadership in the business side from Jim Collin’s Good to Great and almost anything that Buffett writes have been anchors of my thinking. And then outside of that I’ll pick up almost any magazine, and that’s my idiosyncrasy, and read it cover to cover almost. I’ve always been known to carry two or three magazines around with me. It doesn’t really matter. I’m old school like that.', 'And another thing, which is a big hope and also a solution, is that there are quite a few companies that really are serious about having no jerk rules, and don’t allow nastiness to flourish.

They’re a quite large financial services firm and they’re number four in the best place to work list. And Paul Purcell, who’s the Chairman, now CEO, we even got him to blurb the book.', 'Leaders really understand context. What all leaders have in common, Pete, is that they see more than others see, so they see a bigger picture, and they see before others see. They not only see that picture larger than others, they see it quicker than others.

The one is when there has been a breakdown or a disappointment or a breach of trust that we need to talk directly with one another about it rather than everybody else. When there are issues or concerns that the team members are surfacing them directly, those are huge. When there’s an incident of betrayal, a breakdown of trust, how do we respond and where do we go? The second is the issues and concerns and the third you and I have touched on during this call is feedback. The whole aspect of addressing betrayal and breakdowns of trust and surfacing issues of concerns and utilizing feedback as a constructive tool for growth and development, those are very powerful behaviors that when they are present build trust and help to manage change and deepening engagement and at the same time, Pete, these are the behaviors that in our study of over 120 teams and over 500 leaders are the least practiced.', 'Kim Powell \\u2028So, I use an app called Strides, which is I think originally an exercise app, but you can customize your goals.

Brad, tell me, if folks want to learn more or get in touch, where would you point them?', 'One person, I think that somebody that I really admire who is also not a jerk, and I got to know him fairly well the last two years, is Ed Catmull. Ed Catmull is the president of Pixar Animation and the president of Disney Animation. So he’s been involved in leading two major things. One is building almost from the very beginning. Well, really from the very beginning. Pixar, which is one of the great startups became a great animation studio, and then he and John Lasseter in particular, they turned around Disney Animation Studio.

Okay.”', 'Some of the other extremes I have heard that people do is they’ll go see how someone treat a receptionist or a security guard.

And he’s got a net worth of well over $100 million that he created himself. And his whole mission in life is to give it all away. So, what an awesome reminder for those of us driving for success about what it’s really all about. Those are a couple.

If you don’t like it, I can order you something else or I can just save it for later.” And right away, I said, “That’s it.” It was love at first… business partner love at first bite.

I’m like, “No, it was more like half a muffin.”', 'It’s just beautiful, but it is a different aspect of beauty than if you look at the later Renaissance and the Dutch masters such as Rembrandt or Caravaggio where there is realism there. There is darkness and light. Mixed in with that is the beauty of the relationship between the people and the paintings.', 'Yeah. Perfect fit sounds huge. I remember we had a previous guest, Steve Ritter, was saying that there’s some really compelling research that if you’re working with some sort of professional for an intervention, be it a coach or a mentor or a trainer or you name it, counselor, it’s like the fit and rapport between learner or client and provider accounts for just like a substantial proportion of whether or not this thing is going to be successful and deliver what they aspire to deliver.', 'When he was doing Jaws (you probably know this), the mechanical shark, they took one take and then it broke. It couldn’t close its mouth. And they had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this shark, and that was the movie. The movie was cutting back to the shark. And what were they going to do? I mean, he wasn’t that famous then. And then suddenly his Plan B was he went to John Williams, he was doing the music, and he said, “Well, maybe if we can just hear the sound of the shark and not see it, maybe people won’t notice so much that they’re not seeing it.” So, of course, John Williams came up with that famous multi-trombone “Pum-pum-pum.” And that was only done because they didn’t have the mechanical shark. And of course, it’s what made the movie amazing because you never saw the shark and you were 10 times more afraid just hearing it rather than seeing it.', 'Yeah. I mean, I’ve said a lot of them already, but I do believe the one that I said about Kurt Wallenda, “Real life is on the high wire.

And whatever your Plan A is, what we found in our research is that you’re probably not going to end up executing or achieving Plan A. I always wanted to be a performer. That’s what I did in my 20’s. I was in a standup comedy troupe. And when I wasn’t making enough money and I turned towards advertising, I realized, “Wow, I can be creative and actually get paid for this. This is a good career move for me.” And I think that we have to stop sticking so much to this idea that “It has to be this.” Steven Spielberg in the Actors Studio said that the best thing he learned as a director was that his Plan B’s were always… the best parts about it was movies. He said, “I was doing…” What was the movie with the shark?', 'I thought Roy Orbison was blind until just a couple of years ago, so my perception of things mean nothing.', 'Beautiful.

I have this fundamental belief that we all deserve it. When it’s present, we all know it and when it’s absent we all know it.

But in terms of that special three to ten people life team, the way I work that out, Pete, is I always like to start with the blue sky. Okay, what’s perfect? What’s ideal? And the blue sky would be those people who are all in some, you know, drive a distance, a view.

And it goes back to an old story with Benjamin Franklin where he wrote about that he had a hater, somebody who was saying bad things him behind his back when he was a young man, when Benjamin Franklin was a young man. So Franklin went to him, and rather than attacking him, he asked if he could borrow a book from him because he’d heard he had a great library. So this guy does him a favor, loans him the book, and then Benjamin Franklin writes him back a letter telling how much he appreciates it.', 'Janice, thanks for joining us here on the How to be Awesome at Your Job podcast.', 'I’ve heard of Bloom.

Her name is Doris Kearns Goodwin.', 'Beautiful. Well, Carmen, this has been a whole lot of fun all over again. Thank you and good luck with MEMZY and all you’re up to.', 'Thanks for having me, Pete. I’m really looking forward to it.', 'In the academic tutoring context, there’s a study from the 1980s called Bloom’s Two-Sigma study. Have you ever heard of this?', 'Michael Dow', 'Guy Bell', 'Matrix is, people are usually on multiple teams. There was a McKenzie survey at the end of last year, which showed that the majority of the people in the US spent at least some of their day, some of their week, working on more than one team. Multiple teams is pretty much the norm. Research shows that people who work in virtual teams are probably, on an average, of about four. If you’re on three or four teams, then whether you’ve got three or four bosses or not, you have these same problems of clarity. How do we make the situation clear when we’ve got, to use your analogy, different people sitting as different work.', 'I talk to kids about their phones all the time, and I love the excuse of, “Oh, I need it in my room because of the alarm clock.” It’s like children, and my own were probably included, have no idea that we had alarm clocks before the phone came out. And I had said, “You know you can get like a Darth Vader alarm clock at bed at Bed Bath & Beyond for about 10 bucks, right?” And so I think that people come up with all kinds of excuses.', 'Dr. John Townsend', 'Hey, it’s great to be with you Pete and your listeners. We’re going to have a wonderful time. I’m looking forward to it.', 'Dr. Richard, thanks so much for joining us here on the How To Be Awesome At Your Job podcast.', 'So, that’s what my, quote unquote “day job” became, and while I was privileged and grateful for the opportunity to work with patients directly, the thing that was really still kind of biting at me was, “How do I do something more? How do I do something grander?” And so, that’s when I came up with The Daily Helping podcast, and the show’s mission is to help people become the best versions of themselves. And of course there are a lot of shows with similar themes, and that’s aspirational. Right, Pete? You’re not going to get a certificate three weeks from now in the mail from me, your wife or anybody else that says, “Congratulations, Pete! You’re now the best version of who you are.”', 'Got it. And Mamie, tell me – is there a particular thing that when you’re sharing your wisdom, really seems to connect and resonate and get folks nodding and re-tweeting and quoting yourself back to you?', 'Pete, I find it always in feedback, in giving feedback, again, there is that setting the intentions, asking the permission, setting the context and talking about what the issue and the struggle is and what’s hard. There’s also, I don’t want to lose sight of that piece that not only acknowledging what works well in the relationship and what one appreciates about the relationship. There’s looking at it from both sides. We’re not just focusing on the problem or the struggle or the deficit, we’re also acknowledging what is currently there that is appreciated. In closing the feedback conversation, there’s always the gratitude and the capturing of what has been understood and learned and gleaned and the sense of appreciation.', 'But the CEO, Jacob Jaber, and then we interviewed some of the baristas there, they have this philosophy that when people are nasty that you kill them with kindness. That’s their philosophy because you don’t want to stoop to their level. And our philosophy is that if somebody is a jerk, we’re better than them. We’re not going to go to that level. So that’s another one of those, if you will, kind of mind tricks to enhance your opinion of yourself so you suffer less. But I really like your perspective with the director because that sounds to me like a very emotionally healthy thing to do.', 'So, in terms of networking, in terms of colleagues – and not just in a work setting; this can certainly apply to your spouse, to your children, to your neighbors – it’s, “What can I do?” That’s the question: “What can I do to add value to you? How can I help you?” The quickest way to put people off is just to start talking about yourself. Nobody wants to hear that. But if we’re genuinely interested… And I’m not talking just paying lip service to Dale Carnegie. These are not secrets; these are things that have been out there for a very long time.', 'Oh, that is interesting indeed. Well, I have a feeling I’m going to get too interested and ask too many questions for the time we have. We had a Dr. Michael Breus earlier on the show, another sleep master, and that was a ton of fun. So I’m going to start right from the get-go. Can you tell us, if you’re thinking about this audience, professionals who like to make it happen, what would you say are some key sleep perspectives right off the bat you think they should keep in mind to be on top of your game sort of day after day?', 'Michelle Lederman', 'Okay, Byron Katie has a website called The Work. I think it’s TheWork.com. Let me see. I’m here on the computer. Let’s just find this out right now. The great thing about our age is we get instant gratification. Yes, TheWork.com.', 'And the other, what other job options you have. And then the other thing, it has to do with the way that you do it. There’s a guy I talk about in the book, some people may remember from 2010 or so, Steven Slater who was a JetBlue flight attendant, and we all know how hard it is to be a flight attendant. I mean, bless those people. They put up, I mean, we hear the stories about when flight attendants are bad, but on a day-to-day basis, they put up with so much abuse from passengers and from all sorts of directions.', 'Pablo Casals, one of the greatest cellists of the 20th century, was still practicing four hours a day when he was 93. And when somebody asked him why, he said that he was bemused that he was asked the question. He said, “Because I’m beginning to see some improvement.” So there is no end point. And the fastest growing demographic in the world are centenarians, are people in their 100’s.', 'In fact, one of the studies that I read recently that talks about this, and then I can share exactly how we’re doing that, was a Mackenzie study where they said organizations need to be both fast at times and stable at other times. About only 12% of the companies they reviewed were able to do those two things at the same time.', 'So, in this moment from when car one hits me, and then the airbag goes off and I’m careening – that whole accident scene that I described to you was maybe three seconds in total. But for me in real time, it felt like it was significantly longer. I’m sitting there, watching the center console crush into my ribs like it’s somebody’s crushing a can of Coke in their hand, and I’m thinking to myself, “I’m about to die.” It wasn’t one of these Ebenezer Scrooge kind of moments, like, “Dear God, let me live and I’ll be a good person.” I was dead. I knew I was going to die.', 'I’ve been very influenced by, well, some people I’ve mentioned. Marshall Goldsmith wrote What Got You Here, Won’t Get You There. Brilliant book. Ken Blanchard, The One-Minute Manager. Peter Drucker, Concept of the Corporation. He’s – and on and on.', 'And the thing that I really admire about Ed, whenever I have long conversations with Ed, I end up having arguments with him. By the way, this is the guy who argued with Steve Jobs for 25 years. He’s argued with the best. And he said Steve never abused him, by the way. So you hear who are saying Steve, he has a reputation of being a jerk, and some people might say that but Ed Catmull denied having a kind of relationship with Steve, but he said, “We sure argued a lot because that’s what it’s like with Steve.” But it’s such a sort of like respectful sort of interaction.', 'I have something on my webpage that seems to intrigue people endlessly. My family is supposedly related to Tecumseh the famous Indian leader. He’s famous of course for this so-called Zero Year Curse, where supposedly American presidents elected in the year ending with double zero would die in office. It actually worked from Lincoln through Kennedy. It didn’t work with Reagan but someone did try to shoot him. I do get somehow that fascinates people that I’m related to him.', 'All right. John, thanks for this, and good luck in all of your leading and relationships, and I hope you’re well-nutriated.', 'A.G. Lafley, the former head of P&G, which is one of our biggest clients, never said the word “I” or “me” in a speech. Always very inclusive. I wrote an article called “The Power of Nice and the Age of Mean” because I feel that people are forgetting this that in the real world, I mean not running for president, but running your own business and trying to attract clients and trying to keep employees, we are forgetting the tenets of what really makes people successful. It is hard work, but the way that you get there is by using the power of nice. And I just feel it’s something that’s being forgotten right now.', 'I mentioned before this nugget that a colleague, Dorothy Siminovich, gave me years ago, and that is that I do think that people resonate with that, and that it reminds us that the way we show up in the first few seconds is that is how we’re seen by others. So, that one is one of my favorites.', 'That’s much appreciated, so a variety of news sources and podcast in particular are great. That’s really striking a chord with me is, I think about one of the smartest people I know his name is Kevin and we were always neck and neck at high school, who is the smartest guy? It’s him. It’s Kevin. It’s not me.', 'So, Dale Carnegie, Napoleon Hill, Jim Rohn – all of these guys have been talking about this forever. And the “birds of a feather” – it’s another spin on the same thing. But the science behind the mirror neurons is our brains adapt to become more like people that we associate with. So, if you want to be really happy and successful, there’s a reason why being around really happy and successful people push you into that space as well. And the mirror neurons are the hardwired science behind that. So I guess I backed into that response, but I’m going to own that, Pete, and say that’s my favorite quote.', 'Fun. Thank you. Michelle, thanks so much. This has been really interesting and eye opening and I think a lot of folks are going to kind of recognize a little bit of room for improvement in their teams and this will make a world of difference. I really appreciate it.', 'Well, I can tell you right now one of my favorite ones is the one that I talked about in this book which is this one by Karpicke and Blunt about the retrieval versus repeated review. And it was so brilliant just because it just fit entirely with the idea of how students think about learning and what actually works.', 'Understood. Well, thank you, Linda. There’s so much good stuff here. You tell me, is there anything else you want to make sure that you get a chance to put out there before we shift gears and hear about your favorite things?']\n"

      "Carmen, welcome back to the How to Be Awesome at Your Job podcast.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Thank you. Thank you so much and welcome back, everyone.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Well, it’s so fun. There’s only been about three guests who have done, well, exactly three, I believe, who have made a repeat appearance, so welcome. It’s cool to have you in the club here.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Thank you so much. And, you know, repetition is the mother of memory so repeated exposure with yet some statements that people remember.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, that is well-played. You know, Skype just informed me that your birthday is on New Year’s Day.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Oh, I wonder how it got that information. No, it’s actually equally cool birthday. I’m a Halloween baby.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "No kidding? Well, maybe you just set said, “Forget this, Skype. I’m not telling you my birthday. I’m filling in, oh, 1-01.”\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yes, it’s relinking this with the concept of memory. False memories are very much of a cautionary topic for all of us.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Well, I was intrigued because our baby, the due date is January 1.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Oh, there you go. Always at the crossroads for new beginnings. That’s nice.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "So, I guess you’ll be unlikely to share a birthday with our child, but you’re still close in our hearts. It’s so sweet of you to ask for our wedding photo, and I sent you one very belatedly as well. I’ll follow with my thank you notes which is very belated.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you and congratulations. Once again what beautiful pictures.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, thank you. And I just learned that you were once an interpreter at the UN. Can you tell us a bit about that experience, that story?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, what a great job to run the nest on. It wasn’t the Nicole Kidman type but operating in similar environments. So, at the time there was the Bosnia war going if you imagine. Remember the embargo that was placed over Bosnia, so the group that I was assigned to was constantly monitoring those borders and we would constantly do these Danube patrols and I got to work with a lot of CIA and FBI agents.\n",
      "It was an intriguing part of my life. What I retained from it, speaking of memory, is that when memory is concerned, culture plays such a huge role because all of us have such different mental models through which we process our reality. So, I’m sure that all of our listeners have a different mental model as to how you use to spend your Christmases since we’re talking about Christmas before our show. And what your Christmas used to look like was very different than mine.\n",
      "What’s a traditional Christmas for you, Pete?\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Well, the first thing that comes to mind is, well, midnight mass which is actually like at 10 p.m. or so and snickerdoodle cookies.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, there you go. So, if we’re doing the show to impart with our audience some practical guidelines on how to stay on other people’s memory which is the center of my research, what I remember from my interpreter days is that it was much easier to translate and be able to stay accurate to those people’s memories the more that I understood their mental models, so to the extent that I got to be in somebody’s shoes from Germany, or somebody’s shoes from Romania, or somebody’s shoes from France. The translation and the accuracy of those memories was much sharper.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Now, which languages were you interpreting?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "I was interpreting English and French. Now, remember my roots go back to Romania so that’s another language that would belong in there. I could play in some Italian in the good old days so those were the languages that were operated back then at the borders.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Well, that’s impressive. To have those languages, another feather in your cap as memory expert.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, it’s very humbling because as I reflect on what makes something memorable, sensory stimulation is definitely one of the variables that you can use to stay on people’s minds. And when you translate something you can stay on the surface or you can go a little bit deeper in order to understand what you’re talking about. And I’m noticing that a lot of people forget things simply because we do stay on the surface all the time.\n",
      "I’m working on some presentations with some executives just this week, and they’re asking me to create slides for them that express things like business optimization or an improved sales model. And unless you’re getting to those people’s shoes, very much like what we’re doing back then in our interpreting days for France or for England or for Germany, it’s very difficult to come up with something that is fresh and stimulating our senses.\n",
      "Because if you just go to, let’s just say, stock photos and you type in sales optimization, what do you get? Yeah, you’d get those arrows pointing up and people shaking hands because a new deal has been closed. But how memorable are those?\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Now I’m thinking of people dressed up in their business formal wear and suits just like sprinting around a racetrack. I don’t know.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Oh, they go from the racetrack to the top of the mountains, I’m sure you’ve seen those.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "They’re not dressed right.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "And a blank computer screen and just getting very excited, yeah.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Now, so since we last spoke you started your own company, you’ve gone solo. It’s kind of like Justin Bieber or something, out of NSYNC. You got your own company now, it’s MEMZY. And what’s MEMZY all about?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "MEMZY is all about using brain science research to help organizations create memorable content. So, if somebody is reflecting on their own messages, and they’re thinking, “Boy, we’re going to have a hard time expressing this and staying on people’s minds,” then it’s very useful to look at evidence-based guidelines to see what you can do in a more precise kind of way.\n",
      "Because surely you may have some techniques that you’re using right now to create something that’s memorable. But are you sure that those render dividends or is it are you using those techniques simply because they may have worked in the past?\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, intriguing. Intriguing. Well, now we’re back in Episode 11, if folks want to check out the original conversation that we had, and so there might be a couple things repeated, which is just fine for memory as you’ve made clear, but I also kind of want to chart a little bit of new territory. So, I understand that you’ve got some recent research about what it is within stories that make them more memorable than perhaps other stories.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "I do. I just got so tired of hearing people saying, “Stories are memorable all the time.” Like whenever people talk about memory, and you tell them, “Hey, it’s good to make something memorable,” they immediately say, “Shouldn’t you share a story?” And, of course, the intuitive answer is, “Yes, definitely share a story.” But just because you do don’t think that that story will always be memorable or always be memorable long term.\n",
      "So, through the research I did just that, I invited some people to first submit a series of stories, and I asked them to complete the sentence, “I will never forget,” and then fill in the blank. And some people went on for a few paragraphs, and some people went on for longer, some people went professional, some people went personal. Where do you think most of the people went though, personal or professional?\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "I’m guessing personal.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, most of the people who submitted their stories went to a personal space, and that was intriguing to me as a finding, too, by the way, because when your audiences are going to recollect their memories and, hopefully, you’re in there somewhere, they’re going to reach for the memory that comes to their minds more easily, that comes to their minds without much effort. And our personal memories quite often are probably a lot more effortless than the professional ones to recollect.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Intriguing. And so, then what did you notice in terms of like the themes or patterns associated with the stories that folks will never forget?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Most of the stories had obviously some sort of an emotion or some contrast between a state versus another state where they ended up those weren’t necessarily surprising. What surprised me is when I gave these stories to various people to then read, and I asked them, “What is it that you remember from other people’s stories you see?” That’s when I wanted to see, “What’s the overlap? What’s stays in our minds from other people’s stories naturally without you trying too hard?”\n",
      "So, two days later after these people read the initial stories, they received a survey that asked them, “What do you remember?” And I asked them a subsequent question, too, I said, “Now, please try a little bit harder,” exactly for this reason I’m mentioning that the brain is a cognitively lazy organ, and when we are asked a question, especially if we’re not immediately vested, which these people weren’t, we’re going to take the path of least resistance.\n",
      "So, if I asked you, “What do you remember from your last day at work?” You might probably give me one or two things and not really try that hard. Is that true? Like what do you remember from your work last week?\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Last week? It’s so funny. My temptation, talk about lazy, was to just get the mouse and move right over to the calendar and have it do the remembering for me.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, I’m not surprised. That’s what I noticed that that was one of the initial findings is that immediately, for question number two, which is where I’m asking people to, “Please try a little bit harder,” obviously those are more revealing answers than their original answer.\n",
      "So, then the practical guideline that I would have for everyone listening to this is that, one, make sure that if you do have a story, it comes to your audiences’ minds easily, and then you reinforce is in some way if you want to stay there for a long period of time because those surface details are going to be gone very, very quickly. We tend to stay on the surface when recollecting things especially if the reward or if the goal for them to remember is not all that well-stated or not that strong.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Well, it’s funny, now I’m thinking harder per your prompt. And the first thing that comes to mind is we had a podcast guest, Frances Cole Jones, and she sent an email out to her whole list which had her sporting the How to Be Awesome at Your Job podcast T-shirt, which I began sending to guests as a thank you. So, spoiler alert, Carmen.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Nice. Well, see that’s a very smart technique, by the way, because if you want to make stories more memorable, and just any other type of communication more memorable, a good way to do it is to send something that would then trigger people’s memories in some way when you’re not even in the room, so you’re doing it right.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, cool. Thank you. Well, I guess what made the reason that’s so memorable, it’s like, “Well, shucks, I’ve sent out many, many T-shirts,” and I’ve seen some people post on Twitter, like, “Hey, thanks for the shirt. It’s cool.” But it’s like, “Oh, there’s something quite public into the whole email list. What a treat just in terms of being a generous, kind promotional move on her part that is supportive of what I’m doing over here.”\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Congratulations! Congratulations!\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, thank you. Yeah. So, okay, so then we talked about state changes and we talked about I guess noteworthiness is what I noticed. So, what are some of the other ingredients that make them memorable?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, we’re talking about the cognitive ease, so make sure that whatever you’re sharing with your audiences will come to their minds easily.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "But what makes it easy versus hard?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, exactly, so then we have to ask the question, “Well, what happens if we don’t have the chance to ask somebody else to try harder to remember us?” because we don’t always have that luxury. And then the question still becomes, “What comes to people’s minds so effortlessly that they don’t even have to think so hard?”\n",
      "And one of the items is one that we touched upon a little bit earlier which is this strong sensory stimulation. Like, for example, there was one gentleman who contributed a story when he remembered going to Kenya to fix some electricity-related devices. And he was invited at this family and he had brought them a bottle of Coke. And that family, and according to their tradition, whenever you got a gift you had to then share it with everybody else.\n",
      "And he remembers in details going up the hill to this hut and it was something that was built in mud, you know those mud huts. He remembers distinctly the mother and the father and the small kid, and even the grandmother that was sitting on this piece of log and she had glaucoma. And he remembers the holes in this kid’s clothes that were stapled so that there wouldn’t be holes anymore.\n",
      "But the emotion that stood out for him was the fact that these people only had a bottle of Coke, which they had not had for maybe a year before, and they wanted to share with him, and he didn’t even like Coke and it was a warm bottle of Coke. But yet they convinced him to drink some of it, and you take a few sips and then you pass it onto the next person who also take a few sips, and he thought that was the greatest gift he had ever received from a family who pretty much had nothing.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Yes, that’s powerful. And so, then the Coke is right there. We got the red, we got the white visually, we’ve got the taste itself wrapped up in emotion.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Exactly. And then you can almost see like those holes on the clothes that are stapled shut, and you can see the mud hut, and the way that he was expressing it was so visual that later on when I was looking at people’s responses, and I knew that a few of them had read his story, those details were remarked in people’s responses. That’s such a luxury for anyone these days to stay on people’s minds days after you have shared this stimulus. That’s huge.\n",
      "And the advice then that I have for everyone listening is to look at your communication and ask, “How strong of a mental picture are you painting in your audiences’ minds?” Because, quite often, we become forgettable simply because our communication is so darn abstract.\n",

      "Okay. That’s excellent. And so, then I’m thinking right now, as you talk about some clients working with like business process optimization, I guess that seems pretty abstract, but if maybe we’re talking about, I don’t know, logistics or delivery, if you tell a story of a customer who was blown away by receiving that package, I don’t know, like the very next day and they were able to, I don’t know, redecorate the house or serve a patient in the hospital, like something I guess visually that they’re then doing with that product and how the speed made a difference. I’m just sort of grasping here. But I imagine that goes a lot farther than saying, “We’re dropping our average ship time from 2.1 days to 1.4 days.”\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, and you can still show both. I’m not saying then sacrifice one at the expense of another. In fact, a question that I get quite often when it comes to storytelling is, “What’s the difference between storytelling and facts?” And we can’t really approach the question that way because facts can still be parts of stories.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Facts are, I would define them as zoomed-in stories because if I were to categorized all the findings from the research, a story is based on three components. There is a perceptive component in which we can include that sensory stimulation I was sharing with you; we can include a strong context because when I said Kenya you can kind of knew where to go; and we can include action across time. So, all of this are perceptive things, things that you can sense with your senses.\n",
      "Another component is a cognitive one, and facts go in there and meanings and abstracts, so that’s where business people thrive. We enjoy the fact and we enjoy extracting some conclusions from what we say, and those are great. But quite often I think at the expense of the perceptive, we don’t help our audience’s brains to build these strong mental pictures and then we wonder why people forget those facts because they didn’t really know how to imagine those.\n",
      "And then the third one is, of course, the affective component which is where emotions and motivations and aspirations would go.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Okay. Well, can you give us maybe some pro tips to enhancing each of these dimensions?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yes. For the perceptive one, definitely go towards the language that stimulates the senses and keeps us alert. So, the more you can make people see what you saw and hear what you heard, and then almost enable touching what you touched, then that strong language would definitely reside in people’s memories a lot stronger.\n",
      "And, also for the perceptive, don’t forget the action across time. You cannot have a story unless things progress across time, and in business content, hardly anything ever happens. In fact, it’s surprises me when people say, “Oh, just come to our organization and help us tell our story better.” And then I’ll ask, “Well, so what is your story?”\n",
      "And they will say, “We are founded in this year, and we have this many customers, and we have noticed these trends in the industry, and as a result we have developed this amazing web architecture.” You know, everybody has an amazing web architecture these days, “And we have done this and this other thing.” But there’s’ nothing really in a progression across time that is a mandatory component of a story.\n",
      "Like if we were to talk about business stories, for instance, I remember the woman who invented spandex. For all the women listeners, I’m sure that everyone has heard of the product. And when she’s interviewed and you go online and you read her stories, you hear how, at first, she started in her own apartment, and how she was trying on things in the bathroom, and how she was experimenting things in the kitchen, and then she tried to get a meeting with somebody at Neiman Marcus, and the meeting was going poorly until she convinced one of those executives to go with her to the bathroom and try this product on under some white pants.\n",
      "And from then on, she wore those white pants for three years to convince many other people to buy into the product. So, see how things just progress across time. First this happened, then this happened, and as a result this other thing happened. So, we go from A to B to C and each is a consequence of the previous stage, and that’s the mandatory component of a story.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Now, so I’m interested. When it comes to, say, like a business telling a story, a lot of times it’s about growth, “We had this many units or this much revenue, and now we have these many units and this much revenue and it’s much bigger.” And so, but in a way, those aren’t really actions. It’s just sort of an output or measurement. And so, how would you maybe make that translation?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yes, so if we’d go from that list of facts, because if you’re saying, “In 2016 we sold these many units, and in 2017 we sold these many units, and therefore we have grown by this percentage,” that’s almost kind of an action because you would have to make it show, “How did you get to point B as a result of point A?” Was it somebody that you hired?\n",
      "Because, imagine if you said, “In 2016 we sold this, and then we hired this amazing VP of sales. I mean, this guy, he used to work for such and such. And then he sold his company, and then he did some other things. And then he moved to the US, and despite his accent he created all these relationships, and did this and this other thing. And as a result, then here we are 2017 with an increased in this.” So, see how now you’re showing how B is a result of A.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, certainly, “Or that individual customers were so delighted that they shared stories like so and so from Mississippi who put this on her Facebook and sort of shares of that nature just naturally resulted in so many more people buying it, and thusly we have this number of units now.”\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, and you would have to be careful about showing causation which it’s a tricky thing because causation is what we would consider, from a storytelling perspective, a plot. So, you’re saying if your customer has posted such and such on Facebook, and then somebody else saw it and as a result they, too, purchased the product. And then they went to another customer, and as a result of that then this is what happened.\n",
      "And sometimes, especially when we deal with technology-oriented things or science-oriented products, people are so afraid of causation that they will only stick to just a list of facts, inviting the audience to draw their own conclusions, and because we’re saying the audience has such a cognitive lazy inclination anyway, they may not often make that leap. So, not only are you less persuasive but you’re not really sharing a story.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, interesting. So, then, the key distinction there is that, you’re saying, be careful of causation and don’t sort of say it’s because of it, but share what happened. Let’s see, set me straight here, Carmen.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, well, causation is sexy and tricky at the same time. Causation is what enables you to fully stay truthful to a story in a sense of A caused B which then caused C, but then having the boldness and the accuracy to make a causation statement, that’s where it’s at.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Do you have what it takes to stand behind your causation? That’s the question I would ask anyone listening. Because, for example, some of my clients are from the biotech industry, and when they try to sell a specific product to a doctor’s office they have to be cautious about saying, “You will get this product, and as a result, for sure, this is what’s going to happen.”\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "I hear you. So, you don’t say it.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, it doesn’t mean that you always have to share a story, by the way. So, if that’s your field and you’re afraid of causation, you don’t necessarily have to go there, but then don’t claim you’re telling stories.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Okay. So, it’s just about saying that it caused it as opposed to sharing a sequence of events that imply it.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Okay. All right. I’m with you. Tracking along. Thank you. Okay. So, then how about the affective component?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yes, so the cognitive we have no problems with because facts and abstracts definitely dominate. For the affective component, I think one of the biggest insights that I got from this study were that just having the presence of emotions still doesn’t guarantee memory. Sometimes that’s another statement that I hear made very frequently, “Oh, if you want to have something memorable, and especially a memorable story, you definitely have to always have emotion.” Not true.\n",
      "For instance, people will say, “Oh, stories like 9/11, or the Space Challenger disaster, or Oklahoma bombing, those, of course, will be memorable.” Not that fast. For example, in some of the groups that I had designed in my study, people read a 9/11 story, people read a Space Challenger story but they also read stories like, “I will never forget the time when my co-worker complimented me on LinkedIn. It was just such a touchy message, I had posted this, and then they reacted like that, and then I said this. And that just meant a lot to me in my career,” or something along those lines.\n",
      "Or, “I will never forget my cousin’s wedding because this is what happened.” And those things were a lot more memorable than the world’s history stories, so to speak, even though the emotion was not as strong but it was more relatable, you see. So, if you ever have the choice, and you’re looking at your content and you’re thinking, “Boy, my content is kind of dry. I could never match the emotion of a disaster or something that just happened. Everybody paid attention to it.” Don’t even worry about it because relevance quite often trumps emotion.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Okay. Interesting. So, could you maybe help us tie this all together in terms of maybe sharing a couple examples of messages or stories transformed sort of before from one of your clients, and then you did some tweaks and reframing and communicating it differently to an after that had such a greater impact in memorability?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Well, let’s look at this one that I’m working on this week, and it’s not finalized but I think all of our listeners are going to be able to relate to it. So, the before version comes across like this. “Welcome, everyone. We’ve had an interesting and challenging 2017. It’s prompting me to remember why is it I’m working at this place anyway. And I’ve worked here because of some professional opportunities that we all have. It’s also the right timing because the technologies that are happening in the field are just at the right intersection,” and so it goes, and so it goes from fact to fact to fact to fact which is just assumed in story as we said.\n",
      "The recommendations that I’m making and the after example is going to include something along the lines, “Okay, we have had a challenging 2017, and it’s prompting me to reflect why am I working at this company. Well, it’s a wonderful professional opportunity. And what do I mean by this? I remember a time when I was looking for the intersection of just the right technologies, and I was working for this company and this other executive walked in and he said this to me. And then that’s how I reacted, and that’s when I realized that things were a little bit different, and then I read this other article.”\n",
      "And see how I’m going with, “This is what’s happening,” and the more I zoom in and the sensory details are stronger, and he’s able to show pictures of his older executive office, so we can see him working for that company and as he moved to another company. So, now it becomes more become sensory intense and things that happened and then caused another thing and they caused another thing, and now we can abstract it out and say, “It was a great professional opportunity.”\n",
      "Or in the initial, let’s call a story between quotes, he’s talking about coming to work to this company because he wanted to work with people he could trust. Notice how abstract that is. But in the after version, I’m prompting him to say, “Well, so who is that?” So, he’s showing some other guy’s picture and how he served as a best man at his wedding, so we’re killing two birds with that stone because not only is he now showing some sensory stimulation that’s stronger because, “I enjoy seeing the pictures of the wedding and the champagne and people dancing,” but the emotion is now present.\n",
      "Because it’s one thing to say, “I’m working here with people that I can trust,” and it’s just an abstract concept, but another to see them hugging and see them in their suits and see them in such a nice human-like moment.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, I really like that. And so, you’re bringing up the usage of visuals, of slides, which I think can really be helpful because I think sometimes I might feel, perhaps, a little bit awkward going too big and using my words to try to paint an imagery picture like, “Oh, someone fancies himself a novelist over there.” Whereas you could say, “And he was the best man at my wedding,” and then you show an image, and they go, “Oh, that’s the wedding.” And so, then, you can go a long way by bringing those visuals in, even of the desk, of the workplace, of the wedding.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "So true. And the nice thing about being able to do that is then, obviously, those pictures are also going to add the extra words that are even unspoken so you can get a lot more done in a short period of time.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Yes. Well, I was going to go there next in terms of trying to make an impact with a story I think that’s a concern some might say, “You know, well, I’ve got exactly three minutes or five minutes of time to make these points. I don’t have time to go down and make a story especially with all these impactful affective details that you’re describing.” So, what are some of the ways to get some of that goodness in a shorter period of time? One is by using visuals or slides. Any other tips there?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "I really like that question because you’re so right, people are concerned that they don’t have enough time to share stories. And for any of our listeners who are married, and sometimes they get their spouse’s reaction, it’s like, “Come on, get to the point. I don’t have time for all of these details.”\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "I’ve never said that. One year in, I’ve managed to not say that.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "You just recently got married. You just give it a few years.\n",
      "Pete \n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "But executives and some other business audience may have a similar reaction, “Just get to the point.” And so, one of the ways that you could still want to share a story, but you’re afraid that you don’t have enough time, the advice would be to earn the right to tell the details.\n",
      "And the way to do that is to respond first to people’s expectations. And as we said, facts are just zoomed-in stories, and if your audiences are indeed expecting facts at first then give those first. So, if I’m presenting to some executives and they do want to hear about the growth that has happened in the past two years and they want to see some charts, that’s my intro. I’m not going to start with, “It was a dark and stormy night, and the clouds were just approaching, and I knew something drastic was going to happen.” You see?\n",
      "But if I share with you the right amount of information that you expect, then I’m earning the right for a few more minutes of some other details, and then I can say, “The reason that we got to these numbers is because of that one dark stormy night when you would not believe what happened.” So, as a communicator, you’re a choreographer of your audience’s expectations. See to those first and then you earn the right for a few extra minutes where you can fill in the details that would make it a story.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, that’s excellent. Very good. Any other perspectives on the time perspective?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yes. So, obviously, time would be correlated with the length of a story. What I noticed in my study was that there is such a thing as too short of a story beyond which it becomes forgettable. And the length that I noticed people that they remember stories, the sweet spot, was somewhere around 600 words which would be about two or three paragraphs, and I would always suggest that if you want to have a memorable story, write it down first and then make sure that you say it verbally so that you don’t sound as if you’re too scripted. You still speak it. It’s not a story meant for writing.\n",
      "But 600 to about 900 words if you want to be a really polished storyteller because, otherwise, you won’t be having the opportunity to do justice to a context to those sensory details, or build some of those emotions in there.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, now, Carmen, I love it when you drop a number. That’s intriguing. So, 600 to 900 words is a sweet spot there. We’re talking about memory and stories and memorability and this good stuff. Are there any other kind of key rules of thumb or numbers that leap to mind?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, let’s look at this concept of the emotion just a little bit more closely because I think it’s so widely misunderstood when it comes to memory. Emotion, when you’re kind of disconcerting, come from three sources. It can come from the nature of the content, because if you’re talking about medicine or people in Kenya, immediately the nature of the content draws an emotion.\n",
      "But sometimes, in business, we don’t have the luxury of that. We talk about, like you said, trucks or web architectures or predictive analytics. Sometimes there isn’t a whole lot of emotion inherently associated with our content. So, then, what do you do, because you still need some emotion to make something memorable?\n",
      "And the other two sources can be your audience can be a source of emotion. So, if you’re talking to people who are extremely invested in a topic, who are either elated or upset, they bring their own emotions that then contribute to the formation of some memories, or you can be the source of emotion as the transmitter of that message.\n",
      "For example, while I was listening to these people talk about predictive analytics a few months back, and they were the most excited about this product and this technology that I had ever seen. I could have listened to those guys go on forever about predictive analytics. So, as you’re pondering your own question or your own content, question the chemistry that you have with your own content because when that chemistry is there, then you can be the source of emotion, and immediately you’re going to have an increased chance at memory.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "That’s excellent. Well, Carmen, tell me, is there anything else you want to make sure to mention before we shift gears and hear about your favorite things?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Oh, my favorite things. Let’s see, anything related to memory. Since we’re talking about emotion, another reminder that I would have for our listeners is that what we remember is not necessarily the emotion itself. We remember quite often the transition from one emotional state to another. And the sharper the contrast the stronger the emotions.\n",
      "So, for example, let’s just say that I shared with you that I fell off a bike and, obviously, that’s a negative emotion. But then if I said, “I fell off a bike and then got ran over by a car,” see how you reacted, and that’s when the memory got formed, because the first one, yeah, I had some emotion but the sharper the contrast between two emotional states that you’re creating for your audiences then the stronger the memory.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "That’s potent. It’s so funny, I was imagining that you’re going to contrast by going to something really happy, but then you just went to extra, extra bad.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yes, you can go positive and then double positive. Like if I said, “I went to Vegas and I won 50 bucks. And then I pressed a button and next I won 50 million,” that you probably created a memory just now because you went just super, super, super happy. But then you can go the other way of negative to quadruple negative, and that’s how memories are formed.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, excellent. Thank you. Well, now could you share with us a favorite quote, something you find inspiring?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Ooh, a favorite quote. Let’s just see. Just the other day I saw this thing on the internet, and you know we believe everything that we read on the internet, but this quote just really resonated with me. It said, “You have survived a 100% of your worst days. You’re doing great.”\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, that is nice. Thank you. And how about a favorite book?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Ooh, let’s see. A favorite book that I just bought and just started reading is called Supercasting. I’m intrigued by this notion that the brain is constantly on fast-forward as you can imagine, and some people can predict better than others, what gets us to be better predictors.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "When you say predict, you mean just in terms of what is going to happen next in your environment?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Well, intriguing. Thank you.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "And how about a favorite tool?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Oh, a tool. I have to admit that someone just ordered the iPhone X, and they returned it so that’s not going to be a favorite tool. I’m curious as to why that happened. I do like this flashlight that I just got that has different settings depending on how dark or so kind of almost light it is outside. Have you seen those flashlights?\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "So, it’s sensing the environment and adjusting its light?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, small things. Small pleasures.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Nice. Thank you. And then how about a favorite habit?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "A favorite habit is hiking at the end of a full workday.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Beautiful.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "In search of a beautiful view, because you just can’t be hiking. You have to hike with a purpose.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "All right. And is there a particular nugget you’ve been sharing recently at MEMZY that seems to really be connecting and resonating with your clients?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "A particular…\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Just something that you say or share in your work with clients.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Oh, yes, there is. The line that people seem to resonate with and remember is this notion that as we are exposed to content we forget about 90% of that stimulation, so it’s important to control the 10% they remember. So, that has become a favorite mantra, and quite often when people come back to me and they talk to me, they’ll say, “Let me share with you what my 10% message is to my own clients,” and that warms my heart because when they mention that phrase, “What is my 10% or my 10% message is,” then I know I’m able to stay on their minds and that’s a challenge that I share with all of the listeners today. What is your 10%? And are you in control of that?\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "And, Carmen, if folks want to learn more or get in touch, where would you point them?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "MEMZY.com, M-E-M-Z-Y, and the Twitter handler is @areyoumemorable, and of course LinkedIn Carmen Simon. I’d love to stay in touch and I would want to hear what is your 10% message that you want to put on other people’s minds.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "And do you have a final challenge or call to action you’d issue to folks seeking to be awesome at their jobs?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yes, the challenge would be that of precision because we cannot ultimately control everything that goes on in people’s minds, and sometimes we want to overshare. So, I would say don’t attempt to get people to remember more but get them to remember less and better.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Beautiful. Well, Carmen, this has been a whole lot of fun all over again. Thank you and good luck with MEMZY and all you’re up to.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Thank you so much. Thank you, Pete. You do the same.\n",

      "Carmen, welcome back to the How to Be Awesome at Your Job podcast.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Thank you. Thank you so much and welcome back, everyone.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Well, it’s so fun. There’s only been about three guests who have done, well, exactly three, I believe, who have made a repeat appearance, so welcome. It’s cool to have you in the club here.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Thank you so much. And, you know, repetition is the mother of memory so repeated exposure with yet some statements that people remember.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, that is well-played. You know, Skype just informed me that your birthday is on New Year’s Day.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Oh, I wonder how it got that information. No, it’s actually equally cool birthday. I’m a Halloween baby.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "No kidding? Well, maybe you just set said, “Forget this, Skype. I’m not telling you my birthday. I’m filling in, oh, 1-01.”\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yes, it’s relinking this with the concept of memory. False memories are very much of a cautionary topic for all of us.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Well, I was intrigued because our baby, the due date is January 1.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Oh, there you go. Always at the crossroads for new beginnings. That’s nice.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "So, I guess you’ll be unlikely to share a birthday with our child, but you’re still close in our hearts. It’s so sweet of you to ask for our wedding photo, and I sent you one very belatedly as well. I’ll follow with my thank you notes which is very belated.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you and congratulations. Once again what beautiful pictures.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, thank you. And I just learned that you were once an interpreter at the UN. Can you tell us a bit about that experience, that story?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, what a great job to run the nest on. It wasn’t the Nicole Kidman type but operating in similar environments. So, at the time there was the Bosnia war going if you imagine. Remember the embargo that was placed over Bosnia, so the group that I was assigned to was constantly monitoring those borders and we would constantly do these Danube patrols and I got to work with a lot of CIA and FBI agents.\n",
      "It was an intriguing part of my life. What I retained from it, speaking of memory, is that when memory is concerned, culture plays such a huge role because all of us have such different mental models through which we process our reality. So, I’m sure that all of our listeners have a different mental model as to how you use to spend your Christmases since we’re talking about Christmas before our show. And what your Christmas used to look like was very different than mine.\n",
      "What’s a traditional Christmas for you, Pete?\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Well, the first thing that comes to mind is, well, midnight mass which is actually like at 10 p.m. or so and snickerdoodle cookies.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, there you go. So, if we’re doing the show to impart with our audience some practical guidelines on how to stay on other people’s memory which is the center of my research, what I remember from my interpreter days is that it was much easier to translate and be able to stay accurate to those people’s memories the more that I understood their mental models, so to the extent that I got to be in somebody’s shoes from Germany, or somebody’s shoes from Romania, or somebody’s shoes from France. The translation and the accuracy of those memories was much sharper.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Now, which languages were you interpreting?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "I was interpreting English and French. Now, remember my roots go back to Romania so that’s another language that would belong in there. I could play in some Italian in the good old days so those were the languages that were operated back then at the borders.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Well, that’s impressive. To have those languages, another feather in your cap as memory expert.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, it’s very humbling because as I reflect on what makes something memorable, sensory stimulation is definitely one of the variables that you can use to stay on people’s minds. And when you translate something you can stay on the surface or you can go a little bit deeper in order to understand what you’re talking about. And I’m noticing that a lot of people forget things simply because we do stay on the surface all the time.\n",
      "I’m working on some presentations with some executives just this week, and they’re asking me to create slides for them that express things like business optimization or an improved sales model. And unless you’re getting to those people’s shoes, very much like what we’re doing back then in our interpreting days for France or for England or for Germany, it’s very difficult to come up with something that is fresh and stimulating our senses.\n",
      "Because if you just go to, let’s just say, stock photos and you type in sales optimization, what do you get? Yeah, you’d get those arrows pointing up and people shaking hands because a new deal has been closed. But how memorable are those?\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Now I’m thinking of people dressed up in their business formal wear and suits just like sprinting around a racetrack. I don’t know.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Oh, they go from the racetrack to the top of the mountains, I’m sure you’ve seen those.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "They’re not dressed right.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "And a blank computer screen and just getting very excited, yeah.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Now, so since we last spoke you started your own company, you’ve gone solo. It’s kind of like Justin Bieber or something, out of NSYNC. You got your own company now, it’s MEMZY. And what’s MEMZY all about?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "MEMZY is all about using brain science research to help organizations create memorable content. So, if somebody is reflecting on their own messages, and they’re thinking, “Boy, we’re going to have a hard time expressing this and staying on people’s minds,” then it’s very useful to look at evidence-based guidelines to see what you can do in a more precise kind of way.\n",
      "Because surely you may have some techniques that you’re using right now to create something that’s memorable. But are you sure that those render dividends or is it are you using those techniques simply because they may have worked in the past?\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, intriguing. Intriguing. Well, now we’re back in Episode 11, if folks want to check out the original conversation that we had, and so there might be a couple things repeated, which is just fine for memory as you’ve made clear, but I also kind of want to chart a little bit of new territory. So, I understand that you’ve got some recent research about what it is within stories that make them more memorable than perhaps other stories.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "I do. I just got so tired of hearing people saying, “Stories are memorable all the time.” Like whenever people talk about memory, and you tell them, “Hey, it’s good to make something memorable,” they immediately say, “Shouldn’t you share a story?” And, of course, the intuitive answer is, “Yes, definitely share a story.” But just because you do don’t think that that story will always be memorable or always be memorable long term.\n",
      "So, through the research I did just that, I invited some people to first submit a series of stories, and I asked them to complete the sentence, “I will never forget,” and then fill in the blank. And some people went on for a few paragraphs, and some people went on for longer, some people went professional, some people went personal. Where do you think most of the people went though, personal or professional?\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "I’m guessing personal.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, most of the people who submitted their stories went to a personal space, and that was intriguing to me as a finding, too, by the way, because when your audiences are going to recollect their memories and, hopefully, you’re in there somewhere, they’re going to reach for the memory that comes to their minds more easily, that comes to their minds without much effort. And our personal memories quite often are probably a lot more effortless than the professional ones to recollect.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Intriguing. And so, then what did you notice in terms of like the themes or patterns associated with the stories that folks will never forget?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Most of the stories had obviously some sort of an emotion or some contrast between a state versus another state where they ended up those weren’t necessarily surprising. What surprised me is when I gave these stories to various people to then read, and I asked them, “What is it that you remember from other people’s stories you see?” That’s when I wanted to see, “What’s the overlap? What’s stays in our minds from other people’s stories naturally without you trying too hard?”\n",
      "So, two days later after these people read the initial stories, they received a survey that asked them, “What do you remember?” And I asked them a subsequent question, too, I said, “Now, please try a little bit harder,” exactly for this reason I’m mentioning that the brain is a cognitively lazy organ, and when we are asked a question, especially if we’re not immediately vested, which these people weren’t, we’re going to take the path of least resistance.\n",
      "So, if I asked you, “What do you remember from your last day at work?” You might probably give me one or two things and not really try that hard. Is that true? Like what do you remember from your work last week?\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Last week? It’s so funny. My temptation, talk about lazy, was to just get the mouse and move right over to the calendar and have it do the remembering for me.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, I’m not surprised. That’s what I noticed that that was one of the initial findings is that immediately, for question number two, which is where I’m asking people to, “Please try a little bit harder,” obviously those are more revealing answers than their original answer.\n",
      "So, then the practical guideline that I would have for everyone listening to this is that, one, make sure that if you do have a story, it comes to your audiences’ minds easily, and then you reinforce is in some way if you want to stay there for a long period of time because those surface details are going to be gone very, very quickly. We tend to stay on the surface when recollecting things especially if the reward or if the goal for them to remember is not all that well-stated or not that strong.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Well, it’s funny, now I’m thinking harder per your prompt. And the first thing that comes to mind is we had a podcast guest, Frances Cole Jones, and she sent an email out to her whole list which had her sporting the How to Be Awesome at Your Job podcast T-shirt, which I began sending to guests as a thank you. So, spoiler alert, Carmen.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Nice. Well, see that’s a very smart technique, by the way, because if you want to make stories more memorable, and just any other type of communication more memorable, a good way to do it is to send something that would then trigger people’s memories in some way when you’re not even in the room, so you’re doing it right.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, cool. Thank you. Well, I guess what made the reason that’s so memorable, it’s like, “Well, shucks, I’ve sent out many, many T-shirts,” and I’ve seen some people post on Twitter, like, “Hey, thanks for the shirt. It’s cool.” But it’s like, “Oh, there’s something quite public into the whole email list. What a treat just in terms of being a generous, kind promotional move on her part that is supportive of what I’m doing over here.”\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Congratulations! Congratulations!\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, thank you. Yeah. So, okay, so then we talked about state changes and we talked about I guess noteworthiness is what I noticed. So, what are some of the other ingredients that make them memorable?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, we’re talking about the cognitive ease, so make sure that whatever you’re sharing with your audiences will come to their minds easily.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "But what makes it easy versus hard?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, exactly, so then we have to ask the question, “Well, what happens if we don’t have the chance to ask somebody else to try harder to remember us?” because we don’t always have that luxury. And then the question still becomes, “What comes to people’s minds so effortlessly that they don’t even have to think so hard?”\n",
      "And one of the items is one that we touched upon a little bit earlier which is this strong sensory stimulation. Like, for example, there was one gentleman who contributed a story when he remembered going to Kenya to fix some electricity-related devices. And he was invited at this family and he had brought them a bottle of Coke. And that family, and according to their tradition, whenever you got a gift you had to then share it with everybody else.\n",
      "And he remembers in details going up the hill to this hut and it was something that was built in mud, you know those mud huts. He remembers distinctly the mother and the father and the small kid, and even the grandmother that was sitting on this piece of log and she had glaucoma. And he remembers the holes in this kid’s clothes that were stapled so that there wouldn’t be holes anymore.\n",
      "But the emotion that stood out for him was the fact that these people only had a bottle of Coke, which they had not had for maybe a year before, and they wanted to share with him, and he didn’t even like Coke and it was a warm bottle of Coke. But yet they convinced him to drink some of it, and you take a few sips and then you pass it onto the next person who also take a few sips, and he thought that was the greatest gift he had ever received from a family who pretty much had nothing.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Yes, that’s powerful. And so, then the Coke is right there. We got the red, we got the white visually, we’ve got the taste itself wrapped up in emotion.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Exactly. And then you can almost see like those holes on the clothes that are stapled shut, and you can see the mud hut, and the way that he was expressing it was so visual that later on when I was looking at people’s responses, and I knew that a few of them had read his story, those details were remarked in people’s responses. That’s such a luxury for anyone these days to stay on people’s minds days after you have shared this stimulus. That’s huge.\n",
      "And the advice then that I have for everyone listening is to look at your communication and ask, “How strong of a mental picture are you painting in your audiences’ minds?” Because, quite often, we become forgettable simply because our communication is so darn abstract.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Okay. That’s excellent. And so, then I’m thinking right now, as you talk about some clients working with like business process optimization, I guess that seems pretty abstract, but if maybe we’re talking about, I don’t know, logistics or delivery, if you tell a story of a customer who was blown away by receiving that package, I don’t know, like the very next day and they were able to, I don’t know, redecorate the house or serve a patient in the hospital, like something I guess visually that they’re then doing with that product and how the speed made a difference. I’m just sort of grasping here. But I imagine that goes a lot farther than saying, “We’re dropping our average ship time from 2.1 days to 1.4 days.”\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, and you can still show both. I’m not saying then sacrifice one at the expense of another. In fact, a question that I get quite often when it comes to storytelling is, “What’s the difference between storytelling and facts?” And we can’t really approach the question that way because facts can still be parts of stories.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Facts are, I would define them as zoomed-in stories because if I were to categorized all the findings from the research, a story is based on three components. There is a perceptive component in which we can include that sensory stimulation I was sharing with you; we can include a strong context because when I said Kenya you can kind of knew where to go; and we can include action across time. So, all of this are perceptive things, things that you can sense with your senses.\n",
      "Another component is a cognitive one, and facts go in there and meanings and abstracts, so that’s where business people thrive. We enjoy the fact and we enjoy extracting some conclusions from what we say, and those are great. But quite often I think at the expense of the perceptive, we don’t help our audience’s brains to build these strong mental pictures and then we wonder why people forget those facts because they didn’t really know how to imagine those.\n",
      "And then the third one is, of course, the affective component which is where emotions and motivations and aspirations would go.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Okay. Well, can you give us maybe some pro tips to enhancing each of these dimensions?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yes. For the perceptive one, definitely go towards the language that stimulates the senses and keeps us alert. So, the more you can make people see what you saw and hear what you heard, and then almost enable touching what you touched, then that strong language would definitely reside in people’s memories a lot stronger.\n",
      "And, also for the perceptive, don’t forget the action across time. You cannot have a story unless things progress across time, and in business content, hardly anything ever happens. In fact, it’s surprises me when people say, “Oh, just come to our organization and help us tell our story better.” And then I’ll ask, “Well, so what is your story?”\n",
      "And they will say, “We are founded in this year, and we have this many customers, and we have noticed these trends in the industry, and as a result we have developed this amazing web architecture.” You know, everybody has an amazing web architecture these days, “And we have done this and this other thing.” But there’s’ nothing really in a progression across time that is a mandatory component of a story.\n",
      "Like if we were to talk about business stories, for instance, I remember the woman who invented spandex. For all the women listeners, I’m sure that everyone has heard of the product. And when she’s interviewed and you go online and you read her stories, you hear how, at first, she started in her own apartment, and how she was trying on things in the bathroom, and how she was experimenting things in the kitchen, and then she tried to get a meeting with somebody at Neiman Marcus, and the meeting was going poorly until she convinced one of those executives to go with her to the bathroom and try this product on under some white pants.\n",
      "And from then on, she wore those white pants for three years to convince many other people to buy into the product. So, see how things just progress across time. First this happened, then this happened, and as a result this other thing happened. So, we go from A to B to C and each is a consequence of the previous stage, and that’s the mandatory component of a story.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Now, so I’m interested. When it comes to, say, like a business telling a story, a lot of times it’s about growth, “We had this many units or this much revenue, and now we have these many units and this much revenue and it’s much bigger.” And so, but in a way, those aren’t really actions. It’s just sort of an output or measurement. And so, how would you maybe make that translation?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yes, so if we’d go from that list of facts, because if you’re saying, “In 2016 we sold these many units, and in 2017 we sold these many units, and therefore we have grown by this percentage,” that’s almost kind of an action because you would have to make it show, “How did you get to point B as a result of point A?” Was it somebody that you hired?\n",
      "Because, imagine if you said, “In 2016 we sold this, and then we hired this amazing VP of sales. I mean, this guy, he used to work for such and such. And then he sold his company, and then he did some other things. And then he moved to the US, and despite his accent he created all these relationships, and did this and this other thing. And as a result, then here we are 2017 with an increased in this.” So, see how now you’re showing how B is a result of A.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, certainly, “Or that individual customers were so delighted that they shared stories like so and so from Mississippi who put this on her Facebook and sort of shares of that nature just naturally resulted in so many more people buying it, and thusly we have this number of units now.”\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, and you would have to be careful about showing causation which it’s a tricky thing because causation is what we would consider, from a storytelling perspective, a plot. So, you’re saying if your customer has posted such and such on Facebook, and then somebody else saw it and as a result they, too, purchased the product. And then they went to another customer, and as a result of that then this is what happened.\n",
      "And sometimes, especially when we deal with technology-oriented things or science-oriented products, people are so afraid of causation that they will only stick to just a list of facts, inviting the audience to draw their own conclusions, and because we’re saying the audience has such a cognitive lazy inclination anyway, they may not often make that leap. So, not only are you less persuasive but you’re not really sharing a story.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, interesting. So, then, the key distinction there is that, you’re saying, be careful of causation and don’t sort of say it’s because of it, but share what happened. Let’s see, set me straight here, Carmen.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, well, causation is sexy and tricky at the same time. Causation is what enables you to fully stay truthful to a story in a sense of A caused B which then caused C, but then having the boldness and the accuracy to make a causation statement, that’s where it’s at.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "All right.\n",

      "Do you have what it takes to stand behind your causation? That’s the question I would ask anyone listening. Because, for example, some of my clients are from the biotech industry, and when they try to sell a specific product to a doctor’s office they have to be cautious about saying, “You will get this product, and as a result, for sure, this is what’s going to happen.”\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "I hear you. So, you don’t say it.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, it doesn’t mean that you always have to share a story, by the way. So, if that’s your field and you’re afraid of causation, you don’t necessarily have to go there, but then don’t claim you’re telling stories.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Okay. So, it’s just about saying that it caused it as opposed to sharing a sequence of events that imply it.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Okay. All right. I’m with you. Tracking along. Thank you. Okay. So, then how about the affective component?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yes, so the cognitive we have no problems with because facts and abstracts definitely dominate. For the affective component, I think one of the biggest insights that I got from this study were that just having the presence of emotions still doesn’t guarantee memory. Sometimes that’s another statement that I hear made very frequently, “Oh, if you want to have something memorable, and especially a memorable story, you definitely have to always have emotion.” Not true.\n",
      "For instance, people will say, “Oh, stories like 9/11, or the Space Challenger disaster, or Oklahoma bombing, those, of course, will be memorable.” Not that fast. For example, in some of the groups that I had designed in my study, people read a 9/11 story, people read a Space Challenger story but they also read stories like, “I will never forget the time when my co-worker complimented me on LinkedIn. It was just such a touchy message, I had posted this, and then they reacted like that, and then I said this. And that just meant a lot to me in my career,” or something along those lines.\n",
      "Or, “I will never forget my cousin’s wedding because this is what happened.” And those things were a lot more memorable than the world’s history stories, so to speak, even though the emotion was not as strong but it was more relatable, you see. So, if you ever have the choice, and you’re looking at your content and you’re thinking, “Boy, my content is kind of dry. I could never match the emotion of a disaster or something that just happened. Everybody paid attention to it.” Don’t even worry about it because relevance quite often trumps emotion.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Okay. Interesting. So, could you maybe help us tie this all together in terms of maybe sharing a couple examples of messages or stories transformed sort of before from one of your clients, and then you did some tweaks and reframing and communicating it differently to an after that had such a greater impact in memorability?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Well, let’s look at this one that I’m working on this week, and it’s not finalized but I think all of our listeners are going to be able to relate to it. So, the before version comes across like this. “Welcome, everyone. We’ve had an interesting and challenging 2017. It’s prompting me to remember why is it I’m working at this place anyway. And I’ve worked here because of some professional opportunities that we all have. It’s also the right timing because the technologies that are happening in the field are just at the right intersection,” and so it goes, and so it goes from fact to fact to fact to fact which is just assumed in story as we said.\n",
      "The recommendations that I’m making and the after example is going to include something along the lines, “Okay, we have had a challenging 2017, and it’s prompting me to reflect why am I working at this company. Well, it’s a wonderful professional opportunity. And what do I mean by this? I remember a time when I was looking for the intersection of just the right technologies, and I was working for this company and this other executive walked in and he said this to me. And then that’s how I reacted, and that’s when I realized that things were a little bit different, and then I read this other article.”\n",
      "And see how I’m going with, “This is what’s happening,” and the more I zoom in and the sensory details are stronger, and he’s able to show pictures of his older executive office, so we can see him working for that company and as he moved to another company. So, now it becomes more become sensory intense and things that happened and then caused another thing and they caused another thing, and now we can abstract it out and say, “It was a great professional opportunity.”\n",
      "Or in the initial, let’s call a story between quotes, he’s talking about coming to work to this company because he wanted to work with people he could trust. Notice how abstract that is. But in the after version, I’m prompting him to say, “Well, so who is that?” So, he’s showing some other guy’s picture and how he served as a best man at his wedding, so we’re killing two birds with that stone because not only is he now showing some sensory stimulation that’s stronger because, “I enjoy seeing the pictures of the wedding and the champagne and people dancing,” but the emotion is now present.\n",
      "Because it’s one thing to say, “I’m working here with people that I can trust,” and it’s just an abstract concept, but another to see them hugging and see them in their suits and see them in such a nice human-like moment.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, I really like that. And so, you’re bringing up the usage of visuals, of slides, which I think can really be helpful because I think sometimes I might feel, perhaps, a little bit awkward going too big and using my words to try to paint an imagery picture like, “Oh, someone fancies himself a novelist over there.” Whereas you could say, “And he was the best man at my wedding,” and then you show an image, and they go, “Oh, that’s the wedding.” And so, then, you can go a long way by bringing those visuals in, even of the desk, of the workplace, of the wedding.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "So true. And the nice thing about being able to do that is then, obviously, those pictures are also going to add the extra words that are even unspoken so you can get a lot more done in a short period of time.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Yes. Well, I was going to go there next in terms of trying to make an impact with a story I think that’s a concern some might say, “You know, well, I’ve got exactly three minutes or five minutes of time to make these points. I don’t have time to go down and make a story especially with all these impactful affective details that you’re describing.” So, what are some of the ways to get some of that goodness in a shorter period of time? One is by using visuals or slides. Any other tips there?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "I really like that question because you’re so right, people are concerned that they don’t have enough time to share stories. And for any of our listeners who are married, and sometimes they get their spouse’s reaction, it’s like, “Come on, get to the point. I don’t have time for all of these details.”\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "I’ve never said that. One year in, I’ve managed to not say that.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "You just recently got married. You just give it a few years.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "But executives and some other business audience may have a similar reaction, “Just get to the point.” And so, one of the ways that you could still want to share a story, but you’re afraid that you don’t have enough time, the advice would be to earn the right to tell the details.\n",
      "And the way to do that is to respond first to people’s expectations. And as we said, facts are just zoomed-in stories, and if your audiences are indeed expecting facts at first then give those first. So, if I’m presenting to some executives and they do want to hear about the growth that has happened in the past two years and they want to see some charts, that’s my intro. I’m not going to start with, “It was a dark and stormy night, and the clouds were just approaching, and I knew something drastic was going to happen.” You see?\n",
      "But if I share with you the right amount of information that you expect, then I’m earning the right for a few more minutes of some other details, and then I can say, “The reason that we got to these numbers is because of that one dark stormy night when you would not believe what happened.” So, as a communicator, you’re a choreographer of your audience’s expectations. See to those first and then you earn the right for a few extra minutes where you can fill in the details that would make it a story.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, that’s excellent. Very good. Any other perspectives on the time perspective?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yes. So, obviously, time would be correlated with the length of a story. What I noticed in my study was that there is such a thing as too short of a story beyond which it becomes forgettable. And the length that I noticed people that they remember stories, the sweet spot, was somewhere around 600 words which would be about two or three paragraphs, and I would always suggest that if you want to have a memorable story, write it down first and then make sure that you say it verbally so that you don’t sound as if you’re too scripted. You still speak it. It’s not a story meant for writing.\n",
      "But 600 to about 900 words if you want to be a really polished storyteller because, otherwise, you won’t be having the opportunity to do justice to a context to those sensory details, or build some of those emotions in there.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, now, Carmen, I love it when you drop a number. That’s intriguing. So, 600 to 900 words is a sweet spot there. We’re talking about memory and stories and memorability and this good stuff. Are there any other kind of key rules of thumb or numbers that leap to mind?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, let’s look at this concept of the emotion just a little bit more closely because I think it’s so widely misunderstood when it comes to memory. Emotion, when you’re kind of disconcerting, come from three sources. It can come from the nature of the content, because if you’re talking about medicine or people in Kenya, immediately the nature of the content draws an emotion.\n",
      "But sometimes, in business, we don’t have the luxury of that. We talk about, like you said, trucks or web architectures or predictive analytics. Sometimes there isn’t a whole lot of emotion inherently associated with our content. So, then, what do you do, because you still need some emotion to make something memorable?\n",
      "And the other two sources can be your audience can be a source of emotion. So, if you’re talking to people who are extremely invested in a topic, who are either elated or upset, they bring their own emotions that then contribute to the formation of some memories, or you can be the source of emotion as the transmitter of that message.\n",
      "For example, while I was listening to these people talk about predictive analytics a few months back, and they were the most excited about this product and this technology that I had ever seen. I could have listened to those guys go on forever about predictive analytics. So, as you’re pondering your own question or your own content, question the chemistry that you have with your own content because when that chemistry is there, then you can be the source of emotion, and immediately you’re going to have an increased chance at memory.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "That’s excellent. Well, Carmen, tell me, is there anything else you want to make sure to mention before we shift gears and hear about your favorite things?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Oh, my favorite things. Let’s see, anything related to memory. Since we’re talking about emotion, another reminder that I would have for our listeners is that what we remember is not necessarily the emotion itself. We remember quite often the transition from one emotional state to another. And the sharper the contrast the stronger the emotions.\n",
      "So, for example, let’s just say that I shared with you that I fell off a bike and, obviously, that’s a negative emotion. But then if I said, “I fell off a bike and then got ran over by a car,” see how you reacted, and that’s when the memory got formed, because the first one, yeah, I had some emotion but the sharper the contrast between two emotional states that you’re creating for your audiences then the stronger the memory.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "That’s potent. It’s so funny, I was imagining that you’re going to contrast by going to something really happy, but then you just went to extra, extra bad.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yes, you can go positive and then double positive. Like if I said, “I went to Vegas and I won 50 bucks. And then I pressed a button and next I won 50 million,” that you probably created a memory just now because you went just super, super, super happy. But then you can go the other way of negative to quadruple negative, and that’s how memories are formed.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, excellent. Thank you. Well, now could you share with us a favorite quote, something you find inspiring?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Ooh, a favorite quote. Let’s just see. Just the other day I saw this thing on the internet, and you know we believe everything that we read on the internet, but this quote just really resonated with me. It said, “You have survived a 100% of your worst days. You’re doing great.”\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, that is nice. Thank you. And how about a favorite book?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Ooh, let’s see. A favorite book that I just bought and just started reading is called Supercasting. I’m intrigued by this notion that the brain is constantly on fast-forward as you can imagine, and some people can predict better than others, what gets us to be better predictors.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "When you say predict, you mean just in terms of what is going to happen next in your environment?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Well, intriguing. Thank you.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "And how about a favorite tool?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Oh, a tool. I have to admit that someone just ordered the iPhone X, and they returned it so that’s not going to be a favorite tool. I’m curious as to why that happened. I do like this flashlight that I just got that has different settings depending on how dark or so kind of almost light it is outside. Have you seen those flashlights?\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "So, it’s sensing the environment and adjusting its light?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, small things. Small pleasures.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Nice. Thank you. And then how about a favorite habit?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "A favorite habit is hiking at the end of a full workday.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Beautiful.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "In search of a beautiful view, because you just can’t be hiking. You have to hike with a purpose.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "All right. And is there a particular nugget you’ve been sharing recently at MEMZY that seems to really be connecting and resonating with your clients?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "A particular…\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Just something that you say or share in your work with clients.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Oh, yes, there is. The line that people seem to resonate with and remember is this notion that as we are exposed to content we forget about 90% of that stimulation, so it’s important to control the 10% they remember. So, that has become a favorite mantra, and quite often when people come back to me and they talk to me, they’ll say, “Let me share with you what my 10% message is to my own clients,” and that warms my heart because when they mention that phrase, “What is my 10% or my 10% message is,” then I know I’m able to stay on their minds and that’s a challenge that I share with all of the listeners today. What is your 10%? And are you in control of that?\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "And, Carmen, if folks want to learn more or get in touch, where would you point them?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "MEMZY.com, M-E-M-Z-Y, and the Twitter handler is @areyoumemorable, and of course LinkedIn Carmen Simon. I’d love to stay in touch and I would want to hear what is your 10% message that you want to put on other people’s minds.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "And do you have a final challenge or call to action you’d issue to folks seeking to be awesome at their jobs?\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Yes, the challenge would be that of precision because we cannot ultimately control everything that goes on in people’s minds, and sometimes we want to overshare. So, I would say don’t attempt to get people to remember more but get them to remember less and better.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Beautiful. Well, Carmen, this has been a whole lot of fun all over again. Thank you and good luck with MEMZY and all you’re up to.\n",
      "Carmen Simon\n",
      "Thank you so much. Thank you, Pete. You do the same.\n",

      "It’s my pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me as a guest.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh yeah. Well, you’ve been on the list since Episode 3 with Victor Prince’s co-author, and now seemed like a fine time. So, I’m glad you made it happen.\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Now I understand you have a bit of a fondness for skydiving. What’s the backstory here?\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "Yeah, not really, and that’s what’s funny about it. So, I was in the army, and I’ve always hated heights. My father used to laugh at me when we would go up on the roof to clean out the gutters and I’m looking like Spider-Man plastered to the roof, just worried about falling off. So when I was in the army, they have you go to military schools during your summers when you’re at West Point. And one of my summers I put in for a specific type of very ground-based training, and the Army and its wisdom decided that I would be much better off jumping out of airplanes. So, I went through Airborne School down at Fort Benning, Georgia, jumped out of a plane five times, got my airborne wings and have never done it since. So, cool experience; not necessarily something that I want to go through again.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Okay. Well, I totally misinterpreted that tidbit here. You’ve done it, but you didn’t enjoy it.\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "I mean, it was cool. It was cool. After the second jump you’re like, “Okay, I’m probably not going to die, so I may as well enjoy the view.”\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Yeah. I’ve done it once and I liked it. I could do it again. My wife isn’t a fan though of the idea.\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "It’s a little different when you’ve got on a rucksack and a simulated weapon and there’s eight of you going out the plane one after the other after the other and you got a static line yanking you around. And you’re only about a thousand feet up and you’re trying to hit that patch of really rough dirt below in the Fort Benning sun. So, you probably had a little bit more of a pleasurable experience.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Well, it was. It was kind of cool, and the breeze falling through…\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "Yeah, we didn’t have that, no.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Well, tell us a little bit about your company thoughtLEADERS.\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "Yeah, we are a leadership development and training firm. We work mostly with large corporates like Google, Abbott, Discover Financial, the Federal Reserve, and we teach topics of leadership, communications, problem-solving, decision-making. I like to say we teach all the topics that everybody needs that nobody ever teaches you.\n",
      "We have a really strong bias toward heavy hands-on application in the classroom, and the thing that I hold up as different about us is we’re all business people. We’re not academicians, we’re not career facilitators; we’re business people up on the podium. So, we understand the participants’ challenges and we’re able to help them bridge from our tools and frameworks to their reality, which then increases the likelihood that they apply our methods.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Okay, excellent. So now, I kind of re-thought of you when I was checking out your LinkedIn learning course Critical Thinking, and I was digging in, enjoying it. And so I’d like to get your take on just the importance of critical thinking in the hierarchy of professional skills. I thought I had seen it somewhere in some report that it was like the top thing professionals need, but I couldn’t relocate it when I tried to Google and prep for today. So maybe you can orient us to that.\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "Yeah. So I believe part of it came out of a New York Times article that was based upon a report that LinkedIn actually put together. And LinkedIn went through people’s profiles, they looked at who got new jobs and what were the skills that they had either explicitly stated on their LinkedIn profile or that they could deduce from the person’s background. And critical thinking was one of the top ones, if not the top one on that list.\n",
      "So, as I look around the importance of critical thinking increases every day, and reason for that is, the speed with which we’re making decisions is so incredible that if you don’t pause and really think through something, you’re going to create a bigger problem. You may have thought you solved the problem, but you just created an issue that is exponentially larger.\n",
      "Pete\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "Yeah, it can either spiral or you can end up solving a problem and then solving it again and solving it again and solving it again, and it ends up being really wasteful and inefficient. And when you’re operating in a world where you need to be moving fast, you don’t have time to be wrong, which means you need to slow down and make sure that you’re right.\n",
      "Pete\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "Yeah, you can take it to the world of construction – when you’re finishing a basement or an attic you’re always taught, “Measure twice, cut once”, and that’s deliberately slowing down, making sure you’re thinking about what you’re doing, and then you take action and the action is correct; rather than, “Measure once, cut once, because I’m really busy and I’ve got to move. Oh look, I just cut the two-by-four on the wrong side of the line and now it’s too short. And now I’ve got to cut another one and another one, and there’s waste involved.”\n",
      "So just by slowing down, looking at what you’re trying to solve, assess the situation properly, come up with a solution and think through the impacts of that solution if you implement it, and then implement – the likelihood of doing something bad in that cycle, because you short circuit it, goes down dramatically.\n",
      "Pete\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "That’s exactly where I was going to go. I don’t think it’s just politics; I think things have started moving so fast and people have so much information overload, that they’re trying to react to everything coming at them as quickly as they’re able, whether it’s an email or a text or a tweet or whatever it is, it requires an immediate reaction. Or they think it requires an immediate reaction – let me rephrase – they think it does. So, they react immediately without thinking it through.\n",
      "And I’ll just use the examples – how many times have you seen an article go flying by on Facebook and it has some provocative headline, and all of a sudden you look at the comments and it’s clear that everybody’s getting all vitriolic or offering their perspective? And you realize 95% of those people didn’t even read the article, right? And it’s just we’re not stopping and thinking critically. Or we do read the article and we don’t step back and say, “Well, hang on a minute. Let’s look at who wrote this article, let’s look at if that person has an agenda, let’s understand how they’re trying to position the information, what information are they not sharing with us in order to influence me to do something.”\n",
      "I had this conversation with a student, a graduate student, who was saying, “Well, I’m going to move to Texas.” I’m like, “Okay. Well, but you live in Pennsylvania. Why are you excited to move to Texas? Do you have family there?” “Well no, no, not at all.” “Okay, why?” They’re like, “I want to get a job in Texas.” “What’s driving this?” “Well, I read this report, and Texas has this and Texas has that and Texas has that, and all these jobs and all this growth and all this stuff.” I’m like, “Okay, so who wrote the report?” “Oh, it was published by the San Antonio Chamber of Commerce.” “Hm, you think maybe there’s an agenda there? Maybe?” And I’m not saying it’s a biased report, but I’m just saying, stop and understand the circumstances of what you are assessing at that moment, and challenge it, challenge yourself.\n",
      "Pete\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "Yeah, so I was an American Politics major at school actually, and you study a lot of the information that’s put out there and how it’s positioned. And one of the things I was always taught was, understand the difference between facts and judgment. So, when you’re reading an article, ask yourself, “Is this a fact or is it the author’s judgments or the newscaster’s judgment of that fact? Is it their assessment of what that fact means, their interpretation?”\n",
      "So by taking whatever piece of information you’re looking at, first of all separate it into the facts and judgments. Then look at the facts first and say, “Okay, are these facts accurate? What was the source of them? What facts are not being included here that could be included that may be skewing the actual facts themselves?” And once you have your arms around what the fact base is and how it may or may not be biased, just with the data collection and data sharing, then you are much better qualified to assess the assessments of those facts and say, “Is this a fair judgment? This author is saying that this company is doing bad things. Okay, based on the facts, would a reasonable person draw the same conclusion, or are they just extrapolating from a single data point?”\n",
      "So by challenging each of those sort of assertions or each of those assessments – that’s critical thinking. That’s asking those questions versus just saying, “Oh yeah, that’s a bad company, of course. They did this one bad thing and therefore they hate people.” It’s like, “Really?” If you separate it out and really question both sides of that pile of information, I think you end up being much savvier, in terms of the information you consume.\n",
      "I don’t watch the news. I go online, I have certain news sources where I am pulling facts from and I’m trying to get as unbiased a set of facts as I possibly can, and then I’m forming my own assessment. “What does this mean?” And sometimes I’m challenging other people’s assessments or I’m asking the questions of, “What’s not here? What’s not being presented?”, but I’m not letting somebody else interpret the facts for me. That’s not happening.\n",
      "Pete\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "For me it ends up being, I’m looking at primary sources. You know what I like? I actually like a lot of the financial websites – places like MarketWatch or E-Trade or whatever. I’m reading business press releases – things about earnings or market research reports or whatever, because I want to get as close to primary facts as I possibly can. And when you go to financial sites, they tend to throw a little bit less assessment into the facts of what’s going on. It’s like, “Okay, here’s the new tax law, here’s what it means, here are the tax brackets, here’s how these deductions go away, here’s the average size of that deduction.” And they just give you the data.\n",
      "And there may be a little bit of interpretation that goes there, there may be a little bit of bias, but that’s much less bias than if I go to CNN or Fox News, and it’s like, “And you get no deduction and you have to murder your first child.” It’s like, “Really?” It’s just so bombastic, because what people don’t understand is news media has become entertainment first and news second. And you need to understand that; you really need to understand what their agenda is. Their agenda is to attract eyeballs, which attracts advertisers, which attracts dollars. It’s really simple. And the way you attract the eyeballs is with very interesting content that I can consume and feeds my ingoing biases anyway, and tells me I’m right.\n",

      "I guess for me it’s a question of, what’s the impact of that item on your life and the world around you, and how much importance do you sort of ascribe to that impact? So for example, I just got this wonderful letter in the mail from my health insurance company, telling me that my premiums for next year have gone from $960 a month to $1,600 a month. So we’re talking, what is that, an 80% increase, something like that? So we’re talking about a big impact on me – I want to understand the facts, and I have wanted to understand the facts for the last several years, around what are the changes in Affordable Care Act, what are the marketplace dynamics, who’s moving into the market, out of the market, because I’m sitting there trying to figure out where is healthcare going. I’ve got three kids – what’s going to be the right plan for me, how do I adjust to this?\n",
      "So I do invest time and energy in understanding that information, seeking out facts and making my own assessment, because it’s going to govern my thoughts on a topic that’s pretty large. It’ll drive my voting behaviors, it’ll drive if I decide to support a particular political candidate one way or the other. Now, let’s contrast that with something that I say it really isn’t important to me and I’m not going to be able to have a big impact on it, other than every first Tuesday in November. So, am I going to really worry about that issue? And if the answer is “No”, then I’m not going to give it any air time; I’ve got better stuff to do.\n",
      "Pete\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "Yeah, I think it’s definitely the 5 “Why’s” and the 7 “So what’s”. So, the 5 “Why’s” – when you see something happen, ask “Why” five times. And by the time you get to the fourth or fifth “Why”, there’s an insight there, there’s a root cause there. The way that works is, we had a client where I learned the 5 “Why’s” the first time, and I was an analyst on the team, and my engagement manager asked me, “Mike, what analysis did you do this morning?” I said, “Well, here are the numbers I ran, and it looks like this one metric is going up.” And he said, “Okay. Well, why?” I said, “What do you mean ‘Why’?” He said, “Why is that metric going up?” And I stopped and I thought and I said, “Well, the client is probably doing this.” And he said, “Okay, why?” I said, “What do you mean ‘Why’?” He said, “Why is the client doing that?” And I stopped and I thought a little bit harder and I said, “Well, they’re probably doing that because of this.” And he said, “Okay, why?” I’m like, “Dude, what is with the ‘Why’s’?” And he said, “Mike, our job is to have insights for our clients. We have to understand the root causes of what’s going on, because once we do, then we can actually make recommendations that address the true problem that they’re facing.”\n",
      "So at that moment I understood what the 5 “Why’s” were, and we continued to walk that back and understand what is driving this behavior. And it turns out we were initially solving for a symptom, and it was something about their compensation plan that was driving a dysfunctional behavior, which drove another dysfunctional behavior, which was driving the metric to go up. So by walking that backward, just stopping and seeing something happening – some event, some symptom – and then walking it back, versus just jumping in to solve the symptom, helps you solve a deeper-seated problem. So that’s the 5 “Why’s”.\n",
      "Pete\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "Yeah, sure. So, let’s see. Let’s talk about my health insurance. Let’s have some fun with this one, not that that’s a raw wound that we’re opening right now. But okay, so my health insurance premium went from $960 a month to $1,600 a month. Okay, why? Why did that happen? Well, it’s because the insurer raised their rates across the entire population. Okay, why? Why did the insurer raise their rates? Well, either because their losses have been going up and they were paying out a lot more in claims last year than they thought, or because they want to be a lot more profitable and they’re just going to start gouging consumers.\n",
      "Now I’m at a fork where I say, “Okay, which of those seems more likely?” And they’re probably not going to gouge, because it’s just bad business to do that; you’re not going to be able to survive long in that market. So it’s probably because their losses are going up. Okay, why is that happening? Well, it’s probably because the risk pool got adjusted a few years ago when there was a change in the law, in terms of who is eligible, whether they’re going to accept pre-existing conditions, and we put a whole bunch of people in the risk pool for getting insurance that didn’t have it previously. So now it’s just a riskier population and those costs are going up. Okay, why? Why did that happen? Well, we were trying to insure more Americans.\n",
      "Okay, now I get it. Now I understand what the root cause was – I changed the eligibility population, and that has these downstream impacts, in terms of the cost of my policy. And then you’ve got to get to a point where you say, “Okay, what do I do about that? Is there something I can do to change the way that we’re handling the people in the risk pool? Well, personally, can I change that? No, but could it inform the way I think about Medicare, Medicaid legislation? Can it inform the political candidates that I decide to back or not back?” And then you’ve also got to step back and say, “Okay, how much is for the greater good?” kind of thing. And that’s just one of those things that you walk it back that far and you understand what really made this happen.\n",
      "Pete\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "I use a tool called a “logic map”, where you have a problem and then you look at what’s driving that problem, and then below that you say, “What are the drivers of that?”, and then below that you say, “What are the drivers of that?” And you just keep disaggregating that big problem into smaller ones. So for example, if my client’s company profits are down, that’s a really big problem; I can’t solve that in one fell swoop. So I break that down and say, “Well, what’s driving profits being being down? Well, it’s either revenues are down or costs are up, or some combination of those two.”\n",
      "Okay well, those are still big problems – let me break those down. Well, if revenue’s down, it’s either prices are down or volume is down. And again, it might be a combination of those two. But that’s still a big problem. So I think the answer might be on the volume side, so let me break volume down. Well, volume is down either because current customers are buying less, or we’re not selling as many new customers. And all of a sudden I can start seeing some possible solutions emerge. I can get my arms around, current customers aren’t buying as much, so maybe I can go out and place some sales calls on my current customers, or I can go out and try and sell that one new customer along the way. So by breaking that big problem down and disaggregating it into its component parts, I can start seeing what the underlying issues are that are driving the big problem.\n",

      "Yeah, a lot of folks hear about the 80/20, but they don’t know its origins. The 80/20 rule was first coined by a guy by the name of Vilfredo Pareto, who’s Italian, of course. And Pareto was a bit of an economist, and he noticed that in Italy, 80% of the land was owned by 20% of the people. And he said, “Well, that’s kind of interesting.” He was also a gardener, and he noticed that 80% of the peas in his garden came from 20% of the pods. And he said, “Well, that’s really interesting, that peas and real estate demonstrate the same behavior – that 20% of the causes drive 80% of the outcomes.” And he coined what’s called “the law of the vital few”, which is really getting you to focus on those 20% of the causes that are driving 80% of the effects.\n",
      "And I had one situation where I was running a team, one of the people on my team had a portfolio of accounts he was responsible for – it was about 500,000 accounts. And he came to me one day and said, “Mike, you didn’t know I was doing this, but I built this awesome model that helps me totally predict behavior of some of the consumers in my portfolio.” I said, “Well, that’s really cool.” He said, “Yeah, and with that production I can take a differential action and I can have financial impact by treating those accounts differently.” I said, “That’s awesome.”\n",
      "I said, “I have two questions. One, how many accounts in your portfolio demonstrate that behavior?” And he said, “Well, about 5,000.” I said, “Okay, second question. How many accounts are in your portfolio?” And he said, “About 500,000.” I said, “Hey, how about we focus on the other 495,000 accounts, because as cool as your model is, affecting 5,000 accounts will not have an impact on this business. So stop messing around with small stuff.” And his behavior building that model was a gross violation of the 80/20 rule.\n",
      "Pete\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "I think the first place to do it is your inbox. And you look at the hundreds of emails that pile up in there, and just think through how much time you’re giving each one and which of those are the important ones and which are the ones that just aren’t. And I look at my inbox and it’s probably blown up right now and I’m constantly getting stuff in there, and I used to get a lot of unsolicited emails from sales people, business development people – since I run my business they’re trying to sell me their solutions or whatever.\n",
      "So I get these all the time. And I used to be a pretty polite guy; I’d be like, “Okay, they’re running a business. I know what it’s like to be an entrepreneur.” I would write them back and say, “No, not really interested. Thanks for your note.” And then they would write me back invariably and say, “Well, are you sure, ’cause this could really work?” And then I’d write back, “No, not really. Definitely not sure.” And I finally sat there and said, “What am I doing? You idiot, you idiot. You’re giving them all this time, and time is your most valuable resource. You didn’t invite them into your inbox, you’re spending time on that 80% of stuff that will drive zero impact.”\n",
      "And I just one day vowed I’m going to change my behavior. If I didn’t invite you to my inbox and it’s not something that with a 10-second glance I look at your email and say it’s a fit for what I do, I delete it. And if it shows up again the next time, I then block your email address, because I don’t even want to deal with the two nanoseconds it takes for me to delete a message. So, where I encourage people to go is, go to your inbox and sort of filter that stuff and say, “Of the 100 messages in there, which are the 20 that actually matter, in terms of my job performance, in terms of team performance? And then what’s the 80% that isn’t going to have any real impact, and how many of those can I delete, how many of those can I just sort of mail it in with a quick response?” And just sort of re-prioritize your work.\n",
      "Pete\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "Well, my inbox is usually pretty manageable; I think right now I’ve got 30 emails in there total, and I’m freaking out a little bit because usually I’m under 15. And the way that I manage that is, I get to do one of three things when I get an email: I can read it and respond immediately; I can read it and delete it; or I can read it and act on it later if it’s something that’s big and meaningful.\n",
      "And and you have to do it right when you read that email; you have to make one of those three choices, because there’s so much friction in our day of, I open an email, I look at it and I say, “Oh, I’ll get to this later.” And then later on I come back and I open it again and I go, “Oh, I’ll get to this later, I’ll get to this later.” And they keep piling up, and just the friction of opening and closing that email, and opening and closing it, will suck so much time out of your day. If instead you open it and say, “Okay, this is from Mike. I understand what he wants; I don’t need to answer this. Delete.” And you delete it in that moment – you’re going to be a lot more efficient, you’re going to actually save a lot of time.\n",
      "Now, for folks that I coach – I do some executive coaching – and when they show me their inbox and there’s like 2,000 emails in there, the first thing we do is we stack it by name, and then we go in and find, “Okay, all of these from Mike – we don’t need those anymore. We highlight them all, we delete them.” After we do that by name and that deletion, then we go through and file ones that can be filed. So a lot of folks will have standard reports, and they’ll get that stack of emails from a report team. It’s like, “Okay, let’s highlight those all and and put them in the report folder, ’cause you don’t need them in your active inbox.”\n",
      "Then we’ll sort by subject line, and we’ll go through. There’s that one thread with 30 messages in it – okay, let’s delete the other 29 in that thread so we’re down to one item in that thread. And usually just those two actions takes care of about 40 to 50% of the inbox, believe it or not, if somebody’s got a really clogged up inbox. And then from there, adopt the new behaviors of read and delete, read and respond, or read and do later, when you have a meaningful chunk of time to act on the request.\n",
      "Pete\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "I think that’s really a function of your role and your style, and how you prefer to consume information. I am a sort of “instant in, instant out” – that’s how my brain works really well. So my email is always open, and when something comes in, I’ll throw an eye to it, and it’ll be read and respond, read and delete, or read and do later, typically. And it’s not like I’m just sitting there glued to the screen all day waiting for emails to come in. If I’m working on something meaningful, like this podcast conversation, my inbox is closed right now. And I know there’s emails coming in. As soon as I get off, I’m going to tackle it and just sort of whack through the things that I can get out of there and know what I’ll do later on.\n",
      "Other people function much better in chunks, so they may do three blocks of email during the day – they may do a morning block, a lunchtime block, and an end-of-day block. But again, it’s still going to be the same behavior that I encourage, which is read and delete, read and respond, read and do later. And read and do later is for something that you can’t respond to in that moment, like I would have to run an analysis for you. I’ll read it and do it later, I’ll put the analysis actually on my calendar and say, “I’m going to block this one hour to do this one email”, and then I will get it done when it comes up on the calendar.\n",

      "No, it’s not that simple. I wish it was, but it’s not.\n",
      "Pete\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "So, when you look at a solution, and let’s say I’m going to fix something, I should ask, “Okay, if I fix this, so what? What happens? What’s the implication?” And then if that implication comes to pass, “Okay, so what? What happens if that gets fixed?” And then if that changes, “Okay, so what?” And what it’s preventing is the issue of, you think you fixed something now, but you created a new problem in the future that you now have to deal with. And by the way, it’s a bigger problem than you originally started with.\n",
      "A lot of times I do this – I’ve finished basements, I’ve finished attics, putting up framing and Sheetrock and wiring and everything, and I don’t always do the “So what’s”. So, at one point I was doing a built-in sort of very simple entertainment center, and I said, “Well, this is going to be hard to construct in place, so what I’ll do is I’ll build the frame on the floor and then I’ll just pick it up and put it in place, and then do all the finishing up there.”\n",
      "So I build this giant frame on the floor, and then I go to put it in place, and I start tilting it up, and I forgot about a guy by the name of Pythagoras, who would have told me, “Hey, you idiot, the hypotenuse when you start tilting this thing up is going to mean that it will get jammed on the ceiling before you put it into place.” So Mike didn’t think about the “So what” if I build this on the floor and I need to stand up, so what happens? Well, that means I’m going to need to stand it up and it’s going to be at an angle. Okay, it’s an angle. So what? Oh, the ceiling height is lower than that angle, which means this is going to get stuck and I’m going to be sitting there beating it with a 5-pound sledge hammer for about 45 minutes to get it into place. So it’s just seeing what new problems you can end up creating if you solve the problem at hand.\n",

      "It does. So The Elegant Pitch is all about how do you create a clear and compelling recommendation with the right facts, the right data, and do so in a way that your stakeholders will buy into it and approve your idea. So, it does require the critical thought to say, “What does my stakeholder want? What is my recommendation and how does it tie to their objectives, therefore what’s the right information that I’m going to need to bring to the table to create a persuasive case? What’s the right way for me to structure my argument? Do I talk about financials and operations and marketing, or do I talk about marketing first, and then operations and financials?”\n",
      "And just thinking about the logic of what’s going to underpin your argument, and then how do you package and share that idea in a clear and compelling way. And the biggest tide of critical thinking is, with critical thinking you come up with your solution – you figured out what the real problem is and you generated a solution – but unless you actually get to implement that solution, then all that thinking is worthless. So, what The Elegant Pitch does is helps you understand once you have that really cool solution, how do you then make it into something that people will sign off on and give you the resources to implement.\n",

      "Okay, cool. Well tell me, Mike – is there anything else you want to make to mention before we shift gears and hear about some of your favorite things?\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "I just encourage folks to just pause. When you find yourself reading something, whether it’s in the workplace or on the news or anywhere – anytime you feel that reaction, just pause and say, “Okay, what’s really going on here?” And parse that and say, “What are the facts, and what are my assessments?” So you see a colleague do something in the workplace and we kind of blow up at it – “Joe is such a jerk and I can’t believe he did that” – it’s like, “Hang on, hang on a second.”\n",
      "Let’s look at the facts of the situation. So, Joe did this. Joe left the printer cover open and therefore the printer wasn’t working.” That’s the fact of the matter. Now let’s draw an assessment from that; let’s come up with other possible causes of what’s going on. Maybe Joe didn’t notice that he left it open, maybe Joe meant to leave it open and he really is a jerk. But before we just jump off and say, “Joe is a jerk”, just stop, think about this for a second and separate fact from assessment, and really challenge those things.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Okay, perfect. Now, could you share with us a favorite quote, something you find inspiring?\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "For me, I go to Hemingway. And the quote is, “But man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed, but not defeated.” And that comes from The Old Man and the Sea, and I read it when I was in 8th grade and you’re not exactly the most cerebral person in the world when you’re a 15-year old boy; you’ve got other things on your mind. And I remember I read that quote and it resonated. And I finally figured it out several years later. The quote stuck with me constantly, and I finally figured out why it spoke to me. And what he’s saying is man is not made for defeat. Defeat as a choice, defeat is, “I give up. I’ve tried as hard as I can, and I just give up” – that’s defeat. Destruction is an external force, and that’s me fighting as hard as I can, as long as I can, and I just lose because the world has bested me and I’ve been destroyed.\n",
      "And what Hemingway’s saying is man is not made for defeat; it’s not in our nature as human beings to give up, it’s not how we’re wired. A man can be destroyed, but not defeated. So anytime I’m sitting there and feeling like something’s going wrong in my life, something’s going wrong with the business, we just lost a big account – whatever it is. And you sit there and you want to throw your hands in the air, it’s like, “Hang on. A man is not made for defeat, so what are you going to do about this? How are you going to tackle this problem that is before you?” And it’s always helped me reorient my thinking during those most challenging moments.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Excellent, thank you. And how about a favorite book?\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "I can’t say any of mine, right? So I’m not allowed to say any of my books. Let’s see. One that I always go to is called The Obstacle is the Way, and it’s basically an exploration of stoicism as it was developed by Marcus Aurelius. Now, I know that sounds like some weighty stuff. The book is like 180 pages long; the first 90 is a study of what is stoicism and who are some famous stoics, and I’m not talking just about Greeks and Romans. He looks at business people, current business people who’ve taken a stoic approach to life as well.\n",
      "And then the second half of the book is how can you apply the principles of stoicism to your life and be able to get through adversity, get over those obstacles that you face. And the reason the book resonated for me is when you go to West Point, which is where I did my undergrad, West Point is it an institution that sort of beats stoicism into you. It’s just daily adversity for four years and you best learn how to overcome those types of obstacles. So the book itself, The Obstacle is the Way, does a really nice job of capturing that school of thought, and then making it something that’s accessible and practical and applicable.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Excellent, thank you. And how about a favorite tool?\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "Are we talking hand tools?\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "Yeah, for me it’s always just been the good old hammer. I’m a simple guy at heart. I was a tank platoon leader; when something was broken, you got out the hammer, you got out the ranch, and you got out the baling wire, because it’s one of those three things that’s going to solve your problem. I guess where I’m going with that is, I like simple tools. The tools that we teach in classes, the frameworks that we use tend to be very simple – the 5 “Why’s”, the 7 “So what’s”, a logic map, because if a tool is simple and you understand how to use it, you’re going to use it more frequently and eventually get really, really good with it.\n",
      "And if I give you a big, complex tool with a lot of different moving parts and it’s got to be plugged in and it’s got 18 steps before you can use it, you’re not going to use it. You’re not going to use it and you’re never going to build any sort of facility with it; you’re going to be frustrated by that tool because it’s so complex. So, for me, I think a hammer is a pretty good metaphor for how I think about learning and training and how we apply our craft in the classroom.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Cool, thank you. And how about a favorite habit?\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "A favorite habit. A favorite habit is getting up same time every day and hitting the same morning routine every day, on days where it’s possible. If I’m getting on a plane – okay, the routine’s out the window. But it’s get up, hit the desk, read the news, update the finances, clear out some of the email from the night before, shower, get changed, have the green tea, and then start in on the day. But just that routine in the morning kind of gets the body moving, gets the brain moving in a certain direction, and it generates that initial momentum for me, that carries through the rest of the day. If you want to mess me up on a given day, change my morning routine. Screw something up in that sequence and I’m just off. And it may be just that I’m obsessive about the way my world works – I don’t know, but that routine is something that I encourage people to find ’cause it gets you in that rhythm pretty quickly each day.\n",
      "Mike Figliuolo\n",
      "I go to personal conversations really, from coaching or from classrooms, and I think one of the biggest things that’s always had a pretty powerful impact on folks when I’ve shared it with them is when I hear somebody say, “Well, I have to do X, Y and Z.” I stop them and I say, “Hang on. You don’t have to. You choose to.” And it’s like, “What? No, I have to go to this meeting with my boss.” I say, “No, you don’t. You choose to go to the meeting with your boss, because you understand there are consequences and you are choosing not to accept a different set of consequences. But you don’t have to do anything.”\n",
      "And just by reframing that and helping people understand, “I am making a choice here” versus being forced to do something, it all of a sudden allows people to regain control of their lives. When you look at somebody who says, “My life is out of control”, they basically outsourced the ability to make decisions to the world around them. And you’ll hear them say a lot, “Well, I have to do this, I have to do that, I have to do that”, and they’ve given up control, and therefore they feel out of control and it’s very disconcerting.\n",
      "Just by that small change in, “Hey, I choose to be on this interview right now, I choose to not send my dogs to daycare when I’m going to be on the interview, and the consequences.” I’ve got a poodle looking at me scratching to get in the room, and I’ve got a Jack Russell playing with a tennis ball over here and I’m hoping both of them don’t bark. But that was a choice – I don’t have to have them in the house when I do this; I made a choice, and there’s consequences to every choice we make.\n",

      "Prescott, thanks so much for being here on the How To Be Awesome At Your Job podcast.\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Yeah, thanks for having me. I’m really looking forward to it.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh yes, me too. And I think we’re going to have some real fun here. And I want to know first of all, why did you name your company Starship Design?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Oh goodness, this is actually kind of funny, because it stemmed from a comment thread on a blog, where we were talking about how to name a design firm. And this is maybe 10 years ago, and the folks who brought it up were saying that you should name a design firm the way you name a band, I don’t know, just coming up with weird names. ‘Cause most people do it like a law firm, and it’s like Rigby Jones. I guess that could be a design firm, but it could also be accounting.\n",
      "And they were saying, “No, you’ve got to do it like a band, it’d be like The Flaming Lips or something crazy like that.” And then people were saying, “What about Santana? What about The Steve Miller Band?” And then it was like, “What about Jefferson Airplane?” And it was like, “No, Jefferson Starship – that’s where you go from print design to web design.”\n",
      "And I was like, “You know, Starship is a good name, just as a name for a design firm.” So that’s kind of where it came from, but also there’s a double meaning because it kind of evokes a sense of futurism and a sense of possibility and a sense of uplifting and going somewhere. So I kind of appreciate that double meaning too.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "I’d take it too, and it makes me think of Star Trek and I’ve known someone who had a hand in doing some design work for the spaceships and stuff that show up there. And it’s really cool. I kind of think, “Oh, do you do starship design for movies and stuff? Then you must be amazing at your job.” So only positive associations.\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Yeah, that’s funny. I have Google alert actually and occasionally I’ve got something where it’s like, “Oh, so and so shows off the new starship design” – and it’s the phrase “starship design”, rather than the proper noun.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "I hear you. Well, that’s fun. And so another thing I want to talk about has some negative connotations. I went and kind of did some research here. I got a huge kick out of the “Your Business Card Sucks” piece that you did earlier.\n",
      "And it just cracks me up because it’s so bold, and I guess it just makes me think of, in Japan and certain countries where looking reverently at a business card… Is just something that you do? And then you just throw that in the face? I think I just got to touch there at least a second.\n",
      "Could you share what are some kind of things that make a business card suck versus being great? If we have the potential to make our own business cards, what should be on there versus not be on there?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Right, right. Well, I’m going to back up just a second. So the blog that I ran for a number of years was called “Your Business Card Sucks”, but that name was really just meant to be kind of inflammatory.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "I’m inflamed!\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "And cheeky, you know. Yeah. And I never actually in real life said to someone, “Hey man, your business card sucks.” I’m just not that kind of person. But the idea is that it’s just showcasing interesting and unique cards. And it’s no longer a site unfortunately – I’m trying to bring it back actually. But it is a Pinterest board, so you can search that. But anyway, to answer the question – most people’s cards don’t suck, per se, they’re just furiously boring, and especially if they’re corporate and someone else designed it. And they just kind of turned up on your desk one day and they have the work fax machine number and you have to accommodate for the one guy that works out of the Singapore office so there’s like five lines of addresses. You know what I’m saying?\n",
      "Those are the types of things that really suck the life out of a business card, and I think they’re great because there’s just a little bit of your personality kind of wrapped up in this very bite size kind of object. And you can do so much with that format, in terms of paper, in terms of material, in terms of photography; or if you’re an artist you could put a piece of your artwork on the back, you could put a pattern or anything that you do. I’ve seen web designers who kind of program their address. You know what I’m saying? It’s like address class = work. That type of thing. So there’s a lot of fun to have with it, so I think they’re great.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "That is fun. I’m looking forward to getting my business cards designed and created. I chatted earlier with Chris Bailey in episode 40-something, I don’t know, we’ve got a lot of episodes now. And so he had his done at a shop called Elegant Press in Lithuania, which is cool ’cause I am Lithuanian – thus Mockaitis is the name. And it has all this kind of cool real textury stuff that you can really just feel, and so I’m excited to have a business card that doesn’t suck; print it up by the folks at Elegant Press shortly.\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Awesome!\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Alright, anyway. Let’s get into some good stuff. So you talk about habits of highly creative people, and I would love to hear some perspective there, in terms of… So this listenership audience, we’ve got all sorts of different folks in some jobs that are very creative, and some jobs that feel almost like there’s very minimal creativity and they’re trying to get a healthier dose in there.\n",
      "But nonetheless, there comes a time when folks need to generate ideas or concepts or options, so what are some of the habits that you mention in terms of getting some of those things up and going cruising so you’re well equipped to answer the call when it comes?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Yeah, okay. Goodness, where do I start? Well, first of all I should say that the origin of that eBook and of that line of thinking anyway is that in the conversations I’ve actually had with creative people, with designers and photographers and writers and all these folks that I talk to on my show, and so I kind of distilled those conversations to get these nine habits. And some of them are really simple when you say them – it’s things like respect your future self, so that has to do with saving documents in a neat way and putting things back in their original place and taking the time now to do something that will make your future self sort of easier.\n",
      "And in terms of the workplace there’s all sorts of these little things, like at the end of the day put away your folders so that the next day you can pick right up where you left off; you know exactly which folder you were using ’cause it’s the one in front. That type of thing. It’s almost at a subliminal level.\n",
      "Goodness, what were some of the other ones? Like outshine your former self, continuous learning, continuous improvement, and the idea that you don’t have to take this huge class, you don’t have to get five Masters degrees, but just become 1% better by constant improvement and constant testing – that was one of them. Find creative distraction is another one; and a lot of folks like to do that with running or some other kind of exercise, where you can just zone out and that will allow you to solve a problem that you’re not thinking of in that moment. The classic shower thought is a great example, and I know for a lot of people they kind of ponder things in the shower and they get out and they have to write it down. And they actually make waterproof notepads for just these types of people.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "I totally bought those.\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Oh yeah.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Aqua notes.\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Don’t freak out is one that I’m really trying to master – that’s a tough one ’cause I think it’s very much tied to your personality. But the idea that if you’re a creative person, if you’re an entrepreneurial-minded person, you’re going to have a lot of ideas, you’re going to have a lot of requests for things and you can be involved in a lot of different things. So it could really be overwhelming, and it’s amazing to me how some people are just so calm in the face of all that insanity, and I’m genuinely in envy of them. And I’m just like, “Is that a super power or what? That you just don’t have this anxiety the way that I do, and the way that some other folks do.”\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Yeah. Let’s pause on that one for a moment here, because I think when it comes to thinking clearly and being able to generate something, some good, unique, novel, kind of creative things. There’s probably some good science behind this too, it’s just that our cortisol or stress stuff in your brain and in your blood really does, in my experience, prevent me from coming up with good thoughts and instead it’s like, “Ahhhh! I’ve got to do something immediately now, now now, now!” As opposed to, “Alright, let’s reflect upon which of these several options may be optimal for going forward.”\n",
      "So it seems like you have not yet mastered yourself or we’re all works in process when it comes to the anxiety piece, but what have you seen in terms of the “how to stay calm and collected when it counts”?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Sure. Well, a lot of people are talking about mindfulness or concentration training or meditation or whatever you like to call it, and that’s been a hard habit to install, honestly. And I’m always trying these things – I really should try to get back to it – but that’s something that people claim really works. And unfortunately I think it’s a long-term play; you can’t really do it for five days and see an effect; you have to kind of commit to it for half a year at least. That’s a big one.\n",
      "I think that balancing your sleep and your diet and your exercise, and it sounds really simple – that’s like middle school stuff – but I think that that plays a big part of it. And then also a certain boldness of just cutting things out of your life, especially if they bring you nothing but stress. And I think a lot of us were conventionally educated and work conventional jobs that we kind of have things that we think, “Everybody does this – I have to put up with this.” You know what I’m saying? And when you actually question it, you could be like, “Yeah, I’m not doing that.” This kind of small acts of rebellion by just cutting things out, that can help you in the long term just stay cool, stay centered. So yeah, that’s a work in progress, definitely.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Now, that’s a great turn of a phrase – “small acts of rebellion”. Is that a Prescott original?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Oh man, I don’t know, possibly. Occasionally I’ll come up with something. And I’m like, “I like the way it sounds,” and I have no idea if anyone said it before, especially if it’s a common word, like “the audacity of hope” – that’s Barack Obama’s of course, but someone probably put those words in that order.\n",
      "I read that book, and in the book he talks about the audacity of hope is really “the audacity to hope”, and it’s really kind of rebellion through idealistic defiance, and then not accepting that things are just stuck the way they are. And that’s a definite analog to the workplace, and especially if you work in a larger organization, there’s so much of this kind of, “Welcome to the show! This is how it is.” And it’s like imagine if, again, these small acts of rebellion kind of improving 1% at the time can make some real progress.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "That’s good. So could you share, what are some specific, I guess, small acts of rebellion or things that folks can often get away with chucking or eliminating, and that they don’t have to do after all?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Wow, tough one. I’m thinking of the last former full-time job, where I just didn’t check my email on their system, on Outlook; calendar invites, all that type of thing. I just did not use that, and if there was some kind of team meeting I would say, “Hey, when’s the team meeting?” and they would say, “It’s Thursday at 10:00”, and I’d be like, “Okay, cool.” I’d be using my own system, but I would not go in there and be like, “Accept changes” and do those types of silly things. That’s a small one.\n",
      "Same thing with PowerPoint, like if someone was going to send me this crazy PowerPoint file, I’m just like, “Okay, I’m going to print this out and then I’m going to remake the entire thing, and if there’s anything that’s too much type that I don’t want to copy over, that means it needs to be re-phrased and re-written all together.” You know what I’m saying? It’s not a matter of me typing it. So I just wouldn’t use PowerPoint; I would send back a PDF and that was that.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Alright. Did you get any sort of backlash in a serious way from that?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Well, not really, because I’m a graphic designer, so when people send me things, they just send me the only thing they’re able to, and they kind of know I’m going to take it apart and do what’s best, and especially if it’s going to a printer or it’s going into some other kind of production, they kind of know I know what’s best.\n",
      "It wasn’t the type of traditional corporate job, where you do give a lot of PowerPoints and that type of thing, fortunately. That’s kind of a weird culture that I’m glad I’ve never been brought into.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "I hear you. At the same time though, you do produce a lot of stuff. You get kind of up and out the door at a healthy rate and you’ve talked with a number of guests associated with workflow and process and how to get things kind of up and humming and cruising, so you are kind of ship it at a healthy rate. So what would you say are some of the key workflow insights you’ve discovered along the way that could be applicable to folks who are into corporate environment?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Sure. Well, I think one thing that’s huge that a lot of folks don’t realize they’re doing it or not doing it, is creating what I call “rituals”. And these are simple things; these are kind of acknowledging and celebrating the steps of the process. And whatever that process is, especially if you have a project that has a definitive beginning, middle, end – you can create these rituals and get everyone on board.\n",
      "So, let me give you an example. Let’s say you’re doing some kind of “Back to School” campaign – it could be a marketing campaign or a kind of fall fashion line, I don’t know. When it comes time to start working on it – six months earlier, in January / February – there can be a moment where you say, “Okay guys, we are now putting this project on the board”, and you actually cut out a piece of paper that says in bold type “Fall Campaign” and can actually put it onto a physical board. And that moment is a little ritual and you can also contribute multiple things at that same time.\n",
      "So the moment you put it on the board, that also reflects the fact that there’s now a folder on the server with that same project name. Or you can also set up in your project management, your invoicing tool, the job number, that type of thing. So you can have multiple rituals that happen at once and I think that’s really important for getting everyone started on the same page.\n",
      "Same thing at the end of a project – you can do a post-mortem on the team and you can actually talk about what went well and what you think you can do better next time. Same thing with archiving something, like pulling it down and saying… This is, again that board, “This is done, we’ve finished it, it’s out the door!” and just acknowledging it and celebrating it.\n",
      "Even if it goes badly, there can be rituals for things that get canceled and maybe even you have a piece of paper that’s the project tracking sheet, I don’t know, I’m making stuff up. But you can actually rip it in half at a team meeting on Thursday morning.\n",
      "That could be a little bit of a ritual, even though it’s sort of celebrating a negative, as you like. But those rituals really keep people working together in the same flow, and I think they build character and kind of culture as well.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh yes, it is true, and it’s fun and it’s something that you can look forward to and appreciate at the same time, like, “We’ve hit a milestone and when we hit a milestone we all go out to dinner or drinks or something. And, alright – here we are and that feels good!”\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Yeah, actually at my last job – and this is a positive memory of my last job – that we created a jar in our department, and the jar was like the swear jar, but it wasn’t for cursing, because we were like sailors up in there, but whenever we broke the rules we had to put a dollar in the jar and so it became the “Jar Rules” and then we cut out a photo of the rapper Ja Rule and put him on the side, so it was like “Ja Rules”. And some of the rules were…\n",
      "Let me give you these examples, ’cause these were methods to correct our own internal personal bad habits, so there were things like accidentally emailing someone at their home email – that was a dollar; if you brought a computer or a tablet to a meeting – that was a dollar; if you emailed somebody about a project rather than posting in the project management software – that was a dollar. All these types of things.\n",
      "Man, I don’t remember them all off the top of my head, but you know what? We trained each other pretty good, and after a while we had to invent new rules, and some of them were not really calling out one individual person, but it was kind of like, “Okay, I know this happens and I know one person is the most guilty of it”, and it’s all from love. But the result of that was that you put in your dollar, you put in 2, 3 at a time, and then next thing you know, you’ve got enough to go buy pizza for the whole team.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Well, that is fun and I really dig that kind of principle, because it also just kind of gets a lot more positivity out there associated with that. It was like, “Dang it, Prescott, you never posted it in the project management software and it’s really ticking me off.” We just sort of sidestep all of that – it was like, “Oops, yeah, you’re right. Here’s a buck, we have a laugh, I’ve supported the pizza fund”, and it’s also reinforcing good behaviors.\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Yeah, and some of them too were, like you said, reinforcing good behaviors, that if you complain without a solution – that’s a dollar, and that might’ve actually been like a $3 penalty; that anytime you observe something that can be fixed, you should be trying to fix it, you should not just be complaining about it. And for a struggling organization, a non-profit, a growing team, whatever it is, you definitely need more solutions than complaining.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Absolutely. Alright, so now I’d like to hear some of your take when it comes to if there are some ruts, when ideas aren’t flowing or you’re not in the groove or the zone, just one of those days. What are some key ways that you recommend folks kind of find inspiration or kind of do something to shift their state of mind so that they can be more effective?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Yeah. Wow, tough one! It should be known I’m not super-human and I suffer from this. Are you kidding me? Man, who was it recently? Someone was talking about the 70% problem – that when you get to 70% completion on a project, there’s always that slump and everybody’s energy just vanishes, and everybody – the client, the designer, whoever – you just want it to be done, you just want the result, you’re tired of the process, you’re tired of the timeline. And man, I know that feeling well.\n",
      "And I think one way to prevent that… So before we get to a solution, it’s just preventing it, is to really chopping up into small increments, so that way you can go faster or slower, at a certain phase you can put things on pause, you can celebrate those milestones like we were saying. But that helps to I think to eliminate some of that 70% problem, because 70% of a phase is a little bit different.\n",
      "I like to do the classic things – get away from your environment, like physically take your computer to a coffee shop, even if you’re just checking emails and doing some writing; go walk and take a different direction home – that’s a small thing but if you change up your environment, you change up what you’re seeing, you’re also changing how your brain is kind of handling questions and quandaries. That’s a good one.\n",
      "I’m a big fitness guy, so sometimes I like to push away from my desk and go to kickboxing class and just beat the crap out of a punching bag. That always helps the wheels get back to turning. And again, on that walk home, especially after you’ve had a good workout, you’d be surprised at the level of clarity that you can bring to a project again.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Beautiful, thank you. And I also got a kick out of researching your stuff – when you start a logo project, you sketch out kind of three different kinds of concepts for folks with a classic version, an evolutionary version and a revolutionary version. And I don’t know why, I really like that kind of framework or sense of three quite distinct options, proposals. And I would imagine that has some applicability to other times when you’re proposing ideas or offering potential solutions or initiatives to any number of things. Do you have any thoughts on that?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox \n",
      "Yeah, I think this is a classic framework, and whether it’s a shortcut, a heuristic – things have different names. But it’s kind of like, why start with a completely blank page if you already have some things that are sort of locked in. And it doesn’t always work, it’s not always a formula, but this is a great starting point. So in this case it’s kind of logo design or identity, generally.\n",
      "I know in advertising there’s a whole number of these; I don’t have them all memorized off the top of my head, but it’s things like celebrity endorsement, competition against the competitor, nostalgia, these other things. Mud slinging, the classic propaganda techniques – these are in politics as well.\n",
      "So you can, “This is the classic “product as hero” ad and it’s the the Toyota Highlander is jumping over a mud puddle,” or whatever it is. That’s almost a type of formula, so whatever the brief is, for again Toyota for that example… They could come into a room and they could just have the no cars and be like, “Okay, product as hero, celebrity endorsement.”\n",
      "And you have these couple of options right from the start, so that’s basically where that came from just these templates are the starting points that are made for you. And no matter who’s listening, I’m sure your workflow, your job has these starting points; you just kind of have to think of them, especially if you’ve done them before you could probably find patterns in your own work.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Now, I’m curious, is there anything else you want to make sure you get to put out there in terms of finding creative inspiration, getting some good workflow cruising, staying in the creative zone over long stretches, before we shift gears into the fast faves?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Well, one thing that’s been interesting is that as an observer, in terms of being a blogger, being a curator, whatever you want to call it, when you look in the back of your mind, saying, “Okay, I have to find something”, you’d be surprised at what you can find. So if I’m reading articles or just looking through magazines or looking on the street, it’s amazing how you always find the thing you’re looking for, as long as you keep your awareness of it.\n",
      "So, one thing I found that’s helpful is that recently – or I guess for a little more than a year already – I’ve been doing a weekly link post on my blog, and this is just sometimes as few as three items that I found that week that are relevant to the topic.\n",
      "And just the fact that you’re continuously looking for these in the background, you’ll find so many more of them. And if you keep track of them, if you keep putting them out there, you’re developing a library for yourself, you’re developing resources that you can use when it’s time to get busy.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Beautiful, thank you. Alright, well, now I’d love to hear a little bit some of your favorite things. Could you start us off by sharing a favorite quote?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Yes. This one I know form John Lennon, I’m not sure where he got it from, but it says, “In order for the forest to be green, every tree must be green.” And this is the idea, simply that, whatever you’re doing as part of a larger group, every single individual must also master that thing within themselves. So it’s about inner peace, but in a teamwork sense it’s pretty obvious.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "And how about a favorite study or experiment or a piece of research?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Yeah, I love things that are counter-intuitive. And one thing that comes to mind is from the book called The Culture Code. And in it he talks about how Nestlé in the ’70s tried to sell instant coffee in Japan, and they had been really successful in Europe and the United States, and they couldn’t get the Nescafé coffee brand any traction, because Japan has such a tea culture.\n",
      "And so what they did was they switched tactics and they created coffee-flavored candy, and they sold it to children and planted that seed. And wouldn’t you know, 20 something years later, they’ve reintroduced the instant coffee, and now that folks had a taste for it, it became very popular in Japan.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "That’s long-term thinking.\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "I know, that is crazy to me. But things like that are counter-intuitive, right? The un-persistent person would just be like, “Okay, they don’t like coffee. Let’s get out of here.” But someone else had this wacky idea, this counter-intuitive idea that, “Let’s not sell them coffee; let’s sell them candy instead.” And the next thing you know, they’ll take to it.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "And how about a favorite book?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Man, where do we start even? I was actually talking with someone about audio books, and I always recommend a great audio book – The Time Traveler’s Wife. And they made it into a movie a few years ago, and the movie wasn’t bad for what it was, but the audio book is amazing, because there’s two principle characters and they switch off perspectives. And so you have two narrators as well, and for with anything to do with time travel, it can get confusing, so you want to have those two narrators – you know if it’s a woman, this is Clare’s chapter, and if it’s a man, it’s Henry’s chapter. So check out The Time Traveler’s Wife.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Alright. And how about a favorite tool? Something that you use often and really boosts your effectiveness?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Yeah. Man, it’s hard to choose one. I read an article a while ago called Take Back Your Mac, which introduces four free tools to use on the Mac. But the one that’s not in that article is TextExpander.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh yeah.\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "TextExpander. Yeah, man, on the Mac it’s all but essential. I don’t know how it’s not built in. There is a Windows version equivalent; I forget what it’s named. But yeah, I would have to say TextExpander.\n",
      "The ability to hide bits of type behind a snippet and have that short code, and just with a few key strokes, you expand out into sometimes paragraphs of text, is immensely helpful. And I use it for little things – I use it for my own name, I use it for my email address, my phone number, ’cause those are the things you type time and time again throughout the day.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "I like to use it to decline podcast guest pitches.\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Yeah, you can put a lot of that in there too.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "So, “Thank you so much for thinking of us. Unfortunately it doesn’t seem like we have quite the right fit here, given our focus on…” And then it’s like… ‘Cause I just feel kind of rude if I just completely ignore folks or I reach out and say, “No”. It’s like, I can give them a little bit of context and maybe they can come back with, “Oh, actually we also cover topics A, B and C.” It’s like, “Okay, now maybe we’re in business, very good.”\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Right, right, right.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Cool. And how about a favorite habit, a personal practice of yours that’s really been helpful?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Yeah, I think I kind of mentioned it though – the ability to constantly be grazing and observing, with the idea that I’m either building this link pack on my blog, or I’m just looking for something to recommend to others. People are always asking me, “Hey, what do you think about this?” And so I like to keep things in the back of my mind as I operate the Internet especially. So I would say the continuous observing and reporting back has been really useful. And especially over time, because you build this body of work, this body of knowledge that really takes some time to grow.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "And how about, is there a particular maybe resonance nugget or piece that you share in your blog, your podcast, your work, that folks really seem to latch on to and nod their heads and re-tweet and say, “Oh yeah, Prescott’s a genius. He said this.”\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Interesting. A lot of metaphors. I’ve gotten compliments on my metaphors, which is kind of funny – the guests will sit there and talk for 10 minutes about these different things. I’m like, “Yeah, we call that ‘shadowing.’” Just make up a term. Apple-saucing is one that we came up with.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Apple-saucing. What does that mean? I’ve got to know. I’ve got to know what’s “apple-saucing”.\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Apple-saucing. Okay, so in the publishing and content industry, whatever you’re calling it, it takes time. You’ve got to plant the seed, it takes time for the trees to grow, and then when they grow it takes time to bear fruit. So that’s your apple – your blog post, your podcast, whatever it is.\n",
      "But some of the apples will not be so good. So what do you do? You create apple sauce, or you create apple butter, or you create apple-flavored fig newtons, or you save the seeds and try to plant more trees. So it’s like continually using the by-products or the second derivative of your original content to re-publish and to appeal to someone else.\n",
      "So, in our example we’re podcasters, maybe the transcript can be put together in some kind of compendium, and folks that like to read rather than listen, might appreciate that.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, that’s fun. Apple-saucing. That reminds me of an Onion article – it’s like a new piece of jargon going around the office, “platforming” – it’s got to be bad news for all of us.\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "The Onion is so great.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Apple-saucing, platforming. I love it. Okay, cool. So now, what would you say is the best way is to find you if folks want to see what you’re up to, learn more – where would you point them to?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Yeah, definitely, busycreator.com – that’s the website for my podcast and blog, and all my social media links are there, as well as a contact form. And I’d love to hear from anyone listening.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Very good. And do you have a final parting challenge or call to action, something that you’d leave folks with, who are seeking to be more awesome at their jobs?\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Yeah. And this usually isn’t in the job context, but I’d like to say it, that there’s a lot of folks giving advice, but not that many giving help. So if you can give help to someone, I think it will be returned many times over to you. So see what you can do about actually helping someone, not just giving them advice.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Beautiful. Okay, well, Prescott, thanks so much. This has been a real treat. There’s some interesting stuff I’m going to be chewing on and applying and apple-saucing. And I wish you tons of luck with The Busy Creator and all you’re up to here.\n",
      "Prescott Perez-Fox\n",
      "Absolutely, man. Thanks a lot!\n",

      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "I’m the worst Gator football fan ever. I went to the University of Florida, which is a big school, cares about football. Yes, I cleaned Tim Tebow’s apartment several times and I did not even know it was him.\n",

      "He was a student there?\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",

      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "That’s a good time. I’m so excited to get into this conversation. We’re going to talk a lot about mistakes and learning and screwing up.

      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "I know. I kind of forgot too. It was some years ago. Talk about mistakes, I made a lot of mistakes with that first podcast. It never really took off, but I learned so much from them. I think we’re going to have a better conversation this time around and it will reach about 100 times as many people.\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "There you go. Love it.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Fo sho. Let’s orient us a little bit. The Student Maid, what’s your company all about?\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Sure. I definitely was not one of those kids that came out of the womb saying I want to be a CEO one day. I want to start a company. I was super lost in college, changed my major nine times.\n",
      "Finally ended up with finance because I’d heard that you can make a lot of money working on Wall Street. I didn’t even know what that meant, but I thought I could figure that out because to me at the time success was about making a lot of money.\n",
      "I used to go to the mall all the time when I was in college and window shop because I could not afford to buy anything. I just so happened to go to the mall this one day. I fell in love with a pair of jeans that I could not afford. It sounds so silly, but my company started because of this pair of jeans. They were 99 dollars.\n",
      "I thought what is something I could do to just make 99 bucks and buy this pair of jeans and just call it a day. My first idea was to put an ad on Craigslist to clean someone’s house. A woman hired me. It was a disaster.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh my. How so?\n",
      "\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Well, I had no idea how to clean. She had a mansion. I told her it would take me two hours. I didn’t have any supplies. I only had like this sponge and a bottle of Windex to clean this 4,000 square foot house. It took me seven hours and I wasn’t even done at the seven hour mark. It was just – she was like, “You need to leave,” because it was dark outside. She had already put her kids to bed. It was a disaster.\n",
      "But she paid me. Then I bought the jeans. Then she actually called me back and said I really need help. She joked and said she could teach me how to clean. That’s how the whole thing started.\n",
      "I cleaned her house every week. She told her friends about me. I forgot to take the ad down off of Craigslist. Then in college as I – every year I gained more clients, but I never thought that this would be my career. The turning point really happened right before my senior year I got this big contract to clean hundreds of empty apartments.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "It was just you at this point?\n",

      "It was just me. Maybe I had a couple people helping me, but they weren’t – it wasn’t a serious business. This was just a side gig.\n",
      "I get this contract. It’s 800 and something apartments. They’re filthy. I hire 60 people to help me with the work. These are all college students who I hired. I have no idea how to lead a team of people. I don’t have any real business experience. I have no idea what I’m doing. Terrible leader. A couple days into the contract, 45 of the 60 people just walk in and quit, like on the spot at the same time.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "It was like in unison, like a group meeting or how did it-\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "It should have been a movie. Yes. It was like – I was sitting in this air conditioned club house in the middle of the complex with my feet propped up eating a Cesar salad. Right before they walked in I remember thinking to myself, this is so easy. Maybe I could be an entrepreneur. I like this. Because I was doing nothing. I was just sitting in this room doing nothing.\n",
      "They walk in. I know something’s wrong because they’re whispering. I can hear someone saying, “Do it. Do it. Do it.” I know in my gut something really serious is about to happen. Then one just stood forward and she said, “We quit.”\n",
      "I remember – I was so shocked. I couldn’t even process what had just happened. It’s so funny to me that I had no clue. I remember thinking, “Why are they leaving,” but now looking back, of course they wanted to leave.\n",
      "The work was absolutely horrible. You’re cleaning empty, filthy college apartments and then you have this leader who doesn’t seem to care about you at all, who’s sitting in the air conditioning with her feet propped up eating lunch and scrolling Facebook. Of course you want to quit.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Understood. Was there like a speech or did they lay out their grievances or they just said, “We quit,” and then it’s done.\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "No, it’s just “We quit.” And they turned around and they walked out. I was shocked, then it turned to anger. I was thinking, “How could they do this? I’m paying them.” There was so much work to do and I only had 15 people left.\n",
      "I ran and I found those people. I told them what happened. They weren’t really surprised. I said, “Well, can you help me figure this out? We have to get them back.” I think they wanted to help me because it sounded more fun than cleaning, not because they really wanted to help me.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "This is a juicy drama. I want to be a part of this.\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "I know. Then someone had this idea to call an emergency meeting at my house that same night and that the way that we would get everyone there is by promising them an early paycheck because the way that it was is you’d have to wait the whole three weeks to get your paycheck, but if they came to this meeting that night, they would get it that night.\n",
      "It was a great idea. Everyone showed up. I just – I was just honest. I said, “I’ve never done this before. I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t even know what I did wrong.” I was honest about how scared I was that we had all this work, that I didn’t know how we would get it done. I think I just – I became a human to them. I think they realized that I was a good person, I just didn’t know how to be a leader.\n",
      "One kind of said, “Oh, I’ll come back,” and then it was a domino effect. Another is coming back and then the next thing you know, they’re all coming back.\n",
      "I always say that that changed the trajectory of my life because it made me really obsessed with learning how to be a better leader and most importantly learning how to build a company where people really, really wanted to be and they didn’t to walk out.\n",
      "That was – that for me was I think looking back, that was the moment that I – I didn’t do it consciously, but I think that’s when I gave up my desire to move to New York and work on Wall Street because that summer really changed everything. We became a team and then I graduated. I turned down a job in finance to stick with Student Maid. Here we are. It’s been nine years.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "That is so cool and congratulations to you. You share these tales and these lessons learned in your book, Permission to Screw Up. Why that title?\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "It’s pretty funny. I always wanted to write a book, but I never knew what I wanted to write about. The way I got my book contract was kind of a backwards way. I was giving a talk. My publisher was in the audience. I just so happened to be speaking about Millennials at that event.\n",
      "My publisher said, “I want you to write a book,” and I started writing about Millennials because I thought that’s what he wanted me to write about. That’s what I had just spoken about. When I finished the book, I didn’t like it. I didn’t actually finish it. Halfway through I said this is not – everything I’m writing about applies to all people, not just Millennials. I threw that version away.\n",
      "Then I started to write about Student Maid and just the journey of leadership and it was empty. I went to dinner with a friend, who’s written several really great books. I asked him, I said, “How do you know when you’re writing the right book?” He said, in my experience the right book is the one that’s really, really hard to write.”\n",
      "I thought about that. The book I was writing was not hard. I changed my thinking to what would make it hard. That’s when I realized that I was writing about all the lessons I had learned, but I wasn’t talking about what it took to learn them.\n",
      "Yeah, I know the importance of empowering people, but I only know that because I micromanage people and people quit. I know the importance of building a relationship that’s real and meaningful with your people, but only because I had superficial relationships that did not lead to trust and loyalty.\n",
      "I wrote about the how I learned it part, which was not fun. Some of the stories I wrote about paint me in a light that I don’t really want to be painted in, but it’s the truth. It’s how I learned.\n",
      "The title, Permission to Screw Up, it’s about giving yourself permission. You don’t need it from anybody else. You don’t have to be perfect. Give yourself permission to screw up and to be human and in doing that, you will inspire the people around you to be more human.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "I like that. I like that a lot. Thank you. Well, you’ve got a lot of wisdom packed in there.\n",
      "Could you maybe share just a couple of the most dramatic shifts that you made in terms of, “Hm, before I was thinking this way and then I had this experience which showed me that, no, that’s totally wrong. I should think about it the other way,” so in the practices that you abandoned or adopted as a result of some of those insights?\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "I would say the first major shift really had to do with feedback. Because 45 people quit on me, I was really afraid to give critical feedback to people because I thought it would make them quit.\n",
      "I was the kind of leader who would recognize people every day for things that really didn’t deserve recognition, like thank you for being on time today. But that’s their job. You’re supposed to be on time. On people’s birthdays I would say thank you for being born. I recognized everything about everyone because I thought that was what – I thought that meant they would be happy and they would stay.\n",
      "I realized two things. One that when we overpraise and we over recognize we actually are doing people a disservice because it doesn’t help them understand what their true strengths and contributions are. It’s also not meaningful.\n",
      "But number two, when we avoid feedback that really needs to be given, the critical feedback, the kind of feedback that really helps people grow, we’re hurting them because we have this opportunity, we see a way they could be better and we don’t speak up, we’re hurting their growth and their development.\n",
      "There’s a student I had who – she did a couple of things. I mean things that were really bad, like trying on a client’s high heels and –\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "What? Doing what to the high heels?\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Trying on a client’s high heels.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, just putting them. Okay.\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Yeah. Or like playing Mary Had a Little Lamb on a client’s antique piano that clearly is off limits. Just stuff that would get under my skin. Every time I would hear about something I would say, “Okay, I’m going to confront her,” and I never did.\n",
      "Then I finally got the courage to do it and I did it in an email. It was a total cop out and then she quit. Then I felt guilty because I felt like man, I really missed out on this opportunity to make her better. Now, chances are the values she had, it wouldn’t have worked out anyway, but I should have told her way earlier that this kind of behavior was not acceptable and I missed out on that opportunity to help her learn and to help her grow.\n",
      "There’s a tool that I loved teaching. It’s in the book. It’s not my own. I learned it from a company called Barry-Wehmiller, one of my favorite companies in the world. It’s called the FBI. It’s a way to give feedback, both critical and recognition, that inspires behavior change or inspires someone to keep doing something great.\n",
      "It’s a sentence. Each letter stands for something, so feeling, behavior, impact. How you felt about someone’s specific behavior and what the impact of that behavior was.\n",
      "If someone’s late, for example, you can say, “I felt disappointed that you were 30 minutes late to our meeting this morning. The impact, even though I know it was not your intention, now the impact is I don’t know if I can rely on you. I don’t want to feel that way, so can you help me?”\n",
      "The idea is that person probably didn’t wake up saying, “I can’t wait to be late so that you’re disappointed and you feel like you can’t rely on me,” but once we tell them, once we tell them how we feel, the impact it’s had, now they want to change that behavior.\n",
      "On the flip side, recognition, you can say, “I felt proud when you spoke up at the meeting this morning and when you shared your opinion. The impact that had is everyone else felt comfortable sharing their own and we had a really productive meeting.” Now you’re telling that person I want to see that again. I want to see you share your opinion again when you have one in a meeting.\n",
      "I love the FBI. Now, in my company, every single person on our team that’s one of the first things they learn even before they learn how to dust and vacuum. We’re big on the FBI.\n",
      "The second thing I would say is about when is it time to give up. That was really hard for me. I’m someone who believes in everyone’s potential. I think it’s really hard when you’re programmed that way when is it time to walk away from someone.\n",
      "On the flip side, if you’re working in an organization and you’re giving it your all and you see the potential in this organization, but it’s just not right for you right now, when do you walk away? Do you walk away?\n",
      "We have this metaphor that we use at Student Maid. It’s called the line. It symbolizes what it takes for the relationship to really work.\n",
      "What we say is the leadership team, the executive team, we’re going to stand at this line every day and what that means is we are going to invest in you, care about you, give you feedback to help you grow, support you, stand by you when you fail. We’re going to give you the tools to do your job and that’s what it’s like standing at the line for us.\n",
      "But it only works if you’re at the line, which means that you’re doing something with the feedback we give you. You’re giving us feedback when there’s room for us to grow. You’re getting back up when you fail. You care.\n",
      "What I’ve learned in this whole thing is you can’t make someone care. You can’t make someone change. You can’t make someone anything. They have to want it.\n",
      "If you are standing at the line, whether you are leading a team of people, whether you’re not, but if you’re at the line and you’re by yourself, I think that’s how you know that it’s time to walk away because you can’t force that other party to stand at the line with you. They have to want to do that.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Understood. Then it sounds like you’ve had some experiences then when others are not standing at the line and they needed to be let go.\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Yes. There was a student we had many years ago. Her name was Kayla. Kayla, she was the best cleaner we had ever seen. You could eat off the floor after she cleaned it.\n",
      "When I met her I learned early on that she had a really rocky home life. She was the first person in her family to go to school. She was fully supporting herself. She came from physical and emotional abuse and made it very clear that Student Maid was like her family. I made a vow to myself that I was going to protect her and keep her as a part of our family no matter what.\n",
      "The problem was Kayla had a real issue with being on time. She was late very often. It wasn’t just five minutes late, ten minutes late, sometimes it would be 45 minutes late. I really struggled with, here’s this person, I know she’s struggling in her personal life and that we mean a lot to her. She’s also a really fantastic cleaner, but yet she can’t be on time. What do I do?\n",
      "It started to cause a lot of tension on the team because other leaders in the company would say, “This isn’t fair. We’re requiring everyone else to have – to be on time, so we have to hold her to the same standard.”\n",
      "What I ended up doing with her is I made exception after exception after exception. It got so bad that she started to not show up to work. Then I just had her cleaning my own house because I didn’t want her actions to impact anyone else.\n",
      "Long story short, I found out that she had a substance abuse problem. She really needed to go and get help for that. I had to eventually walk away from her. She went to a rehab center and she got better.\n",
      "Then after that she called me out of the blue one day and she thanked me for giving up on her. I thought, “Uh, wait, what?” It was the first time anyone ever thanked me for giving up on them. She said, “Had you not walked away from me, I would have never hit rock bottom and I would have never wanted to take ownership over my life.”\n",
      "I realized that you can’t keep giving people chance after chance after chance. You have to – they have to want to change. They have to be open to that. They have to be ready for that.\n",
      "That experience really helped me. It made me realize that sometimes the best thing you can do for someone and even the best thing you can do for an organization is to say, “I’m walking away,” because that’s when the other party decides, “Hm, I need to change something here.”\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Understood. I imagine there are other occasions, maybe less dramatic, in which folks aren’t living up to the line as well.\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Of course. Yeah. I think the key is it should never be a surprise to someone when they’re being asked to leave. This should not be coming out of the blue here. Okay, we’ve talked about this. We’ve made a self-improvement plan. We’ve identified what happens if the plan doesn’t work. Now we’re here.\n",
      "What we find in our company now is that people don’t – we usually don’t have to ask anyone to leave. They come forward and say, “Look, I know we had this agreement for this plan. I didn’t do my part and so now I know that I have to walk away.”\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Yup. That’s powerful. I guess I’m so intrigued by some organizations in which there are some that have a really strong performance culture and expectations and clarity and folks who just clearly need to go and go, then others that just seem terrified of lawsuits and there are hideouts and stowaways and just severely underperforming folks who remain and there is no termination just out of a terror of lawsuits.\n",
      "What’s your take on that? Have you had to deal with lawsuit issues or it’s just been pretty smooth? How do you think about the risk liability side of it all?\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Well, I’ll just say this, you name what can happen in a business, I have been there. I’ve gotten the T-shirt. I’ve done it all, been through it all.\n",
      "But I think when you’re operating out of fear, that’s a problem. The route that I take is let’s never get to that point where there is fear.\n",
      "I think it starts at the beginning. Are you hiring people who really embody the values? Then do your people feel empowered to speak up when they notice that there’s someone on the team who isn’t living the values? How can you make sure that those people aren’t really a part of the company for too long?\n",
      "Then, like I said, the feedback should be regular. It should be ongoing. It should never be a surprise that this person is letting the team down.\n",
      "Yeah, I think you have to live – I think you have to if there’s someone who is not sitting at the line or they’re hurting the organization, they’re hurting the team, they aren’t ethical, they’re not living the values, they have to go.\n",
      "Your fear of a lawsuit or whatever it may be cannot trump that because the message you’re sending to everyone else in the company is actually the values that we say are so important, aren’t that important because we’re letting this person stay on the team.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "So you have been sued?\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Oh yeah. Yeah. But the story I think of when you said that, there was someone I had on the team who I knew was stealing. People had come forward and told me. I was afraid of her. I was afraid that if I confronted her, she would sue me, which is so backwards because it’s like she was stealing from the company. Oh my goodness. What am I afraid?\n",
      "But I let her stay on the team. I was afraid to confront her. The way that she was stealing, she was adding time to her payroll, so she was exaggerating her hours. What ended up happening is she would go to newer people who didn’t really – who were just brand new and she would kind of bully them into lying about their hours so that their hours would match hers.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh, because they’re partners, right?\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Yes, they’re partners. The toxicity spread to so many people. So many people exaggerated their hours. I ended up having to let them all go. Had I just dealt with the problem the first time I heard of it, it would have never grown into that.\n",
      "But that was a huge mistake I made. It cost – then all of the people who came forward and said this is happening and then they watched me do nothing about it, I ended up losing those people because they didn’t want to work with a company where the values and everything we said we stood for we actually didn’t. \n",
      "\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "I think you just have to treat people like – you have to care about people and you have to treat them with respect. You have to treat them the way you’d want to be treated. If you do that, yes, sometimes things get ugly and people are hurt, but I try to look past that and think about what’s the real root of this.\n",
      "Every time where there has been something where someone’s come back to the company, it’s because they were hurt. They didn’t feel cared for. They didn’t feel valued. That’s what made them take this action. I think we just learned a lot from those situations.\n",
      "Sometimes it’s not related to me. Sometimes it’s related to someone who maybe was their leader and they didn’t make them feel valued and cared for. It’s really hard when you’re in this position of leadership. I think it’s really hard to learn the dance between holding people accountable and really making them feel cared for and valued. Until you figure out what that balance is, you’re going to mess up.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "I hear you. Cool. I just wanted to say or hear from you if you have that strong encouragement for those who are in that fearful place of someone needs to be let go but I’m terrified of a lawsuit. To summarize you’re saying, “Don’t live out of fear. It shouldn’t be a surprise.” You’re saying, “It’s absolutely worth it to just – to live out the values and experience some consequences because you really come out ahead.”\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Yeah, yeah. A mentor once gave me some advice that helps me even today. Whenever I’m afraid of something, I think about what is the worst that can happen. I just wrap my mind around what’s the worst case scenario. Then I think about well, what would I do if that happened.\n",
      "Now, all of the sudden I’m not worried because I’ve thought about the worst case. I know what I’ll do. How many times does the worst case actually happen? Hardly ever.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Excellent. Cool. Give us some more pro tips when it comes to cultivating meaningful relationships. You said you used to host parties but that wasn’t quite doing the trick. What is doing the trick?\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Yeah, I used to think relationships were about just being together. When I started the company I was the same age as my team. I had a graduation party and I invited them over. We would go to the same pool parties and this and that.\n",
      "But at the end of the day our relationships were superficial. We were talking about what we were doing over the weekend or what our plans were for summer vacation. It wasn’t really about anything with any kind of depth.\n",
      "Over time I learned that if you really want meaningful relationships, you have to know people deeply. You have to know where they come from. You have to know the experiences that really shape them and the moments in their life that really define who they are. The only way you know is by asking and sharing yourself and being vulnerable yourself.\n",
      "We do regular exercises at Student Maid. It’s called development day. Every quarter we bring our whole company together.\n",
      "We always start with three vulnerability questions. The leadership team will answer the questions in front of the whole room. Then everyone splits off into different teams and they answer the questions amongst their team.\n",
      "Examples are “What is the most challenging relationship in your life and why?” or “What’s a moment that really defined who you are that you haven’t shared with many people?” or “What’s one thing that’s preventing you from becoming a better you that you’re not doing that you should be doing?” Things that really are hard to talk about but when you do, you actually form a connection. You actually build trust.\n",
      "A lot of people look at that and they say, “Wait a minute. This is a little too weird for work and you’re crossing a line.” We never force anyone to share anything they don’t want to share. I’ll say that. But I think it’s so crazy because we spend most of our time at work and with the people we work with and yet we are afraid of crossing this line and forming a real relationship.\n",
      "Well, I don’t want to work with people who I don’t really enjoy working with, who I don’t have high sense of trust with. What is that? I think if we really want to create a place where there’s loyalty and trust, we have to create the space for those conversations to happen.\n",
      "We do that. It’s a huge, huge component of Student Maid. I think actually I think it’s the reason that people want to work for a cleaning company because it’s certainly not the work that’s keeping them there.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Right. That is powerful. The vulnerability questions, which immediately makes me thing of Brene Brown. Then to start with the leadership and front and center is powerful because it’s kind of like we’re not just forcing you to do this, worker bees. Here we are showing the way and putting that example out there.\n",
      "I guess the reason that folks are leaders is because they knew what they were getting into upfront is that this is a part of the game as opposed to – it might be a little bit trickier to spring that on people. “Hey, for tomorrow’s meeting, here’s kind of what I think-”\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Yeah. I think you have to explain to – especially when you’re doing that, it’s – what is the purpose of this. Why are we doing this? What’s the end goal?\n",
      "We always say that relationship is the foundation of accomplishment. Before we can ever talk about accomplishing any goal, we have to have a really strong foundation that’s built on trust and real, meaningful relationships. Until we have that, we can’t talk about our business goals because we don’t have a foundation to stand on to reach those.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Certainly. I would imagine it’s just like if you can share those kind of vulnerabilities – now I’m thinking about the movie Dodgeball. “If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball.”\n",
      "By that I mean, if you can say this thing that’s hard to say, that doesn’t have direct business impact or feedback about performance but it’s important to you, if you can say that, then in a way that just really kind of builds up your capabilities to have other difficult conversations in terms of, “You know what? This performance is really disappointing in these ways,” or “Here’s some perspective I have for you on how I found this challenging or upsetting.”\n",
      "It’s like an icebreaker that actually breaks ice I guess is how I’m thinking about it.\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Right. Yup. Totally.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "That’s cool. Now as a result of sort of all of this stuff, you’ve got some impressive retention rates for your workers as compared to I guess the cleaning industry at large. Could you share just a little bit of sort of where you’re sitting versus the industry norms and any other kind of elements of the secret sauce you think are behind that?\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Yeah, the cleaning industry has such a high turnover rate. 75% is the average.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "That means in one year 75% of a workforce will not be there the next year.\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Because of that the customer turnover is also equally high, 55% is the average.\n",
      "That’s hard but then you add in that in our business model we hire primarily students. Not all students. If you’re a fit for our culture, you’re getting a job, but most of our team members are students. They come with not a lot of job experience.\n",
      "Then the average profit margin of a cleaning company is only 15%, so you can’t really afford to pay people much above minimum wage. You’ve got hard, exhausting work, can’t afford to really train, develop. You don’t have a lot for that. Then you have people coming into my business with hardly any experience.\n",
      "It’s a huge challenge, but we really evolved early on from being a cleaning company to a company that is centered around growth and leadership. We always say that we – our goal is to help our people build a skillset that really will help them be successful after they leave our doors. Everything we’re doing is about getting them ready and equipping them with the skills they need to be successful for after they leave us.\n",
      "Because of that, I think people really feel invested in. I know they feel invested in and they don’t want to leave. While they’re cleaning, they’re taking courses on things like the FBI and how to find your strengths and articulate them in an interview and how to build meaningful relationships, what is vulnerability, what is empathy, how do you listen, what things should you text about, what things should you talk face-to-face about.\n",
      "We do all of this stuff that doesn’t have anything to do with dusting or mopping or vacuuming but really does help you in your life.\n",
      "Then what happens is people graduate and it’s time to move on from the company and they don’t want to go because they’re like, “Will I be able to find another company where I’m invested in?” Sadly I think there are a lot of companies that don’t do that. I wish more would. I dream of the day when every company invests in people like we do the bottom line.\n",
      "I think the average person stays with us until they leave school. For some that may be four years, for some it’s two years, depending on when they join the team. It isn’t uncommon – sometimes we have to tell people, “You’ve got to go. It’s time to go and branch off and go out there and make the mark you want to have on the world.”\n",
      "But I think it shows that it doesn’t matter what industry you’re in, what the work is that you’re doing, you can find a way to really inject purpose and meaning into that work. As long as you’re making people feel like they are the priority because they are, they usually don’t want to go anywhere else.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "That’s excellent. So cool. I want to get your quick take on Millennials, not to belabor the point. But I mean you’ve got perhaps one of the most privileged vantage points of any human alive in terms of working with young folk, doing menial work. What’s your take on what’s real versus silly, overgeneralizations when it comes to Millennials?\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "I’ll tell you two stories quickly. One is a student who came into the office and said, “Do you know where I can get a stamp?” We said, “What? A stamp?” She said, “When I need one, my mom mails me one and I don’t have time to wait for that.” We’re like, “Your mom mails you a stamp when you need a stamp. Oh my goodness, we can get you a stamp way faster than that.”\n",
      "It would be really easy for me to tell you that story and then at the end say, “Ah, Millennial,” but I’m not going to say that.\n",
      "Then I’ll tell you this other story and it’s that my mom works with us. She’s a Baby Boomer. I gave everyone an assignment not too long ago where they had to write their own job description. I said it needs to be around 500 words. When my mom turned hers in she kept saying, “It’s either 503, 504, 498. I don’t know. I counted so many times. I keep getting a different number.”\n",
      "I realized that she did not know about word count on Microsoft Word and she was hand counting every single word on her job description. It would be really easy for me to say, “Ah, Baby Boomers,” after that, but I’m not going to.\n",
      "I think the point is, we’re all just trying to do our best. We’re all just trying to figure it out. It’s really easy to make fun of Baby Boomers, just like it’s really easy to make fun of Millennials, really easy to make fun of Gen X.\n",
      "We’re all humans, so let’s just put this … away and let’s just instead focus on how can we just create a place that brings out the best in everyone, that helps everyone realize their potential, and remember that at the end of the day we all want to feel valued and significant and trusted. That’s the thing we have in common. Let’s focus on that.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "That sounds a lot easier than doing an elaborate segmented-\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Yeah, it’s way easier.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "-intervention person by person based on their generation. That’s great. It sounds like you don’t really buy into so much the so-called assertions that Millennials are this way as opposed to Boomers which are that way.\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "I do think that there are things that help shape a generation. We employ Gen Z as well as Millennials. That’s primarily our makeup.\n",
      "I think technology has really affected both. I think that it’s affected our independent thinking because when we have a question our first thought is that we Google it instead of thinking of it on our own. When we need directions, we type in the address and step-by-step it tells us exactly what to do. We don’t have to think about where we are.\n",
      "Then on the relationship end, we’re used to texting and social media, so sitting and having a real conversation that’s really based on vulnerability maybe isn’t comfortable because we’re not used to that.\n",
      "But then I think about, well that’s definitely affected us, let’s look at everyone else. When I walk into conference rooms with other people, I see people on their phones all the time. It’s not just Millennials. I see people emailing about important things that really should be face-to-face all the time, not just Millennials.\n",
      "I think technology has affected everyone and the way we interact and the way we think. I think it’s affected Millennial in Gen Z’ers more because that’s really the way that we grew up, but I think that’s something that’s widespread.\n",
      "Also, almost 70% of the world is disengaged at work. That’s not a Millennial statistic. That’s a human statistic. To me what it’s saying is this isn’t a Millennial problem. This is a human engagement problem. We have to figure out how are we going to help everyone become more engaged.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Perfect. Well, Kristen, tell me, anything else you really want to make sure to mention before we shift gears and hear about some of your favorite things?\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "I think – no. You’re good.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh shucks.\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "I love this interview.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Flattery will get you everywhere Kristen. I appreciate it. Well, let’s do it. Tell us about a favorite quote, something you find inspiring.\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "I don’t know who said it. Well, I have two. I don’t know who said either one. The first is, “Nothing goes to plan and that is the plan.” That just helps me realize that when something happens that’s a deviation, instead of getting frustrated, realize that it’s all part of the process. One day when you look back it will all make sense.\n",
      "The other really helps me in terms of empathy. It’s that, “Hurt people hurt people. Loved people love people.” It helps me when someone’s emotions kind of exceed the moment or they’re angry about something and I cannot understand why they’re taking this out on me, I just remember that hurt people hurt people. They’re probably hurting inside about something else, so I need to come at them with empathy instead of anger.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Excellent, thank you. How about a favorite study or experiment or bit of research?\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Oh, I love John Gottman’s work.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Oh yeah.\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "I’m obsessed with it. He, if you don’t know John Gottman, look him up. He studies – he’s a psychologist who works a lot in marriage and family space, but I find a lot of the work he’s done can be applied to the workplace. Absolutely.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Thank you. How about a favorite book?\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Oh, I have so many. Probably the book that influenced me most early on, Delivering Happiness, which is written by Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappos.\n",
      "It really helped me understand what culture is and that is that it’s not things like having the cool office and a ping pong table and beer on tap, that it’s really about how people feel. Then it got me thinking, how do I want people to feel and how do I help them feel that way.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "How about a favorite habit, something that helps you be awesome at your job? I’m sorry, scratch it. Your favorite tool, something that helps you be awesome at your job.\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "I don’t know if this is a tool. I guess it’s more of a habit, but every night before I go to bed I think about what are the three things I want to accomplish tomorrow. I’m really clear on that because during the day there are so many things that happen that take you away from important stuff.\n",
      "I think the night before identifying what are the three things that if I accomplish these, I’ll go to bed feeling like today was a win. It just helps me stay focused when things can get so crazy.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Is there a particular nugget that you share that really seems to connect and resonate with folks as you speak it?\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Well, I think it’s the title of the book. I think it’s that you don’t need anyone to give you permission to screw up; give it to yourself.\n",
      "Just give yourself permission to be human and talk about it because I think we’re making leadership unattainable because we’re acting as if you’ve got to have all the answers and know how to do everything in order to be a leader. That’s not true. Everyone can be a leader. Everyone can have an impact on the person to the right of them or the left of them.\n",
      "Sometimes we’re going to mess up in figuring that out and it’s all right and that’s normal. Let’s just admit that.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "If folks want to learn more or get in touch, where would you point them?\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Well, all my social media is my name Kristen Hadeed and then you can go to my website KristenHadded.com or StudentMaid.com.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Okay. Do you have a final challenge or call to action you’d issue to folks seeking to be awesome at their jobs?\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Let’s see, since we talked about FBIs, how about give someone at work an FBI in person.\n",
      "Pete Mockaitis\n",
      "Perfect. Well, Kristen thank you so much for sharing this. This was so much fun.\n",
      "Kristen Hadeed\n",
      "Thank you.\n",

       "'Yeah. One thing I thought about a lot, and I think folks in the corporate world will really be able to identify with this. I hope I’m not convincing you right now to quit your jobs and do something else, because that’s not my intent. I remember when I was giving the graduation speech at Harvard, it’s a lot of pressure. It’s 30,000 people that you’re speaking to. It’s graduation day, you don’t have your notes, you have to speak from memory, and there’s not a podium it’s just a thin mic in the crowd. They assign you a mentor to help you with that, who reviews your speaking. You have speaking training with him 2, 3 times a week. By the way, one of the things he taught, this is a more minor point, was, “You’ve got to hit the adjectives when you speak because the adjectives describe.” Instead of saying, “Wow, that’s a beautiful car,” you say, “That’s a beautiful car.” Now all of a sudden it pops. That’s another little speaking tip for people, hit the adjective. Now, actually the really sad thing about the situation Pete is that he actually had cancer. He was in charge of the entire writing program at Harvard, very well known in the community. I got to work with him as he was at his deathbed. By the end I had to ride my bike to his house because he couldn’t get … It was a 15 minute bike to campus anymore he was so sick. He shared something with me that I’ll never forget. He said, “As I look back on my life I’ve had the chance to do so many things.” He said that the thing that really meant the most to him was that at the end of the day he did what he wanted to do. It was really simple, but he says, “I didn’t spend my life doing stuff I never wanted to do.” He says, “That seems so important to me now.” That was pretty profound for me to hear as I was leaving Harvard, to hear this mentor who was dying of cancer, and he died very shortly after my speech, talk about how important that was. I would challenge all the folks on the podcast, are you doing what you want to do? Are you doing some stuff you don’t want to do? Some stuff you had no business doing? What are you going to say when you’re in Richard Marius’ situation later on? Are you going to say, “Well I spent my life doing stuff I never wanted to do, or I didn’t want to do and now I’m at my deathbed.” To me that’s sad. By the way, I’m not saying do what I do, or what Pete does, because we’re all different. I have a lot of friends who love being in the corporate world. Who, that’s what they are meant to do. They enjoy it. Really that speaks to them. I have friends who are more like myself who float around a lot more and like running their own small business, that kind of thing. I would challenge anybody here, life is too precious, we live in too great a time and too great a country where we have these opportunities to do anything less than what we really want to do. Search your heart, figure out what that is, and find a way to do it.'"
